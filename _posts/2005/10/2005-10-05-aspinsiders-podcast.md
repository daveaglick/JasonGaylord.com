A group of ASPInsiders (including Wally McClure, Phil Winstanley, Ryan TS, Paul Glavich, Dave Sussman, Chris Frazier, Doug Reily, Ambrose Little, Aaron Seet, Alex Homer, and myself) created a new podcast about some of the new great features coming out surrounding [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/ "Microsoft") Technologies. We have discussed things such as Atlas, [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/ "ASP") 2.0, WWF, and more!

It's now official! As announced by [Soma earlier today](http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2005/10/27/485665.aspx), Visual Studio 2005, .NET 2.0, and SQL Server 2005 have been released. VS 2005 and SQL Server 2005 have been sent off to manufacturing. If you have an MSDN Universal or the new Visual Studio Team Server Editions, you can downloadÂ them from the [MSDN Subscriber website now](http://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions) (although it will take awhile - as you may expect). The framework redistributables and SDK are available for [download on the Microsoft website](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads).  
  
Congratulations to all of the related teams at [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/ "Microsoft") for getting this out there!

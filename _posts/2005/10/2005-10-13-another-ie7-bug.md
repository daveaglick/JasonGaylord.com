In an [original post](http://windowsadvice.com/blogs/jason_n_gaylord/archive/2005/08/05/Internet_Explorer_7_Beta_1_Initial_Bugs.aspx), I mentioned a few bugs or annoyances with the first IE 7 Beta. In addition to the controls already mentioned that have issues with IE7 Beta 1, the WYSIWYG controls such as FreeTextBox have issues as well. For instance, I'm typing in the full HTML of this post right now because the FreeTextBox control doesn't know how to render this control. I can't wait for a new build and this to be resolved.

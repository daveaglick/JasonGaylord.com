I came across a post on [Barry Gervin's blog](http://objectsharp.com/blogs/barry/archive/2005/10/19/3511.aspx)Â (a Solutions Architect MVP) that MSN Search now supports Algebraic expressions. That's pretty cool. I can just see some students now trying to cheat in Algebra class. Go ahead and try it. Type in (x\*2)^3=1000. You should receive x=5.

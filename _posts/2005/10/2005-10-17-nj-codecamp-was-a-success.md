[Don Demsak (DonXML)](http://www.donxml.com/) and [Scott Watermasysk (ScottW)](http://www.scottwater.com/) did an awesome job putting together the [NJCodeCamp](http://www.njcodecamp.org/). For my 9:00am session on Web Parts in [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/ "ASP") 2.0, I'm proud to say that we had "standing room only." For my 10:15am session on Membership and Role Management in [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/ "ASP") 2.0, we moved to a room 2-3 times the size of our earlier room and it was probably 80-90% filled. I stayed around for a bit and saw that many of the other sessions were packed in as well. Thanks to both Don and Scott for inviting me to come and present. I have pictures I'll be posting very soon.

I'll be presenting at the 2005 NJCodeCamp being held this Saturday, October 15, 2005 at the [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/ "Microsoft") Office in Iselin/Edison, NJ. The two topics I will be presenting are Web Parts in [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/ "ASP.NET") 2.0 and Membership and Role Management in [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/ "ASP.NET") 2.0. Both of these presentations have been revised quite heavily since the last time I presented these topics and will be posted on my website by Sunday.  
  
The schedule for this event has been posted at [njcodecamp.org](http://njcodecamp.org/). [Scott Watermasysk](http://scottwater.com/) mentioned to me this morning that there were 20 open slots. I'm not sure if these are still available, but you can visit the registration site at [http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032283191&Culture;=en-US](http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032283191&Culture=en-US) to check it out.

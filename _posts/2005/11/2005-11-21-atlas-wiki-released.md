In case you missed a late post by [Paul Glavich](http://weblogs.asp.net/pglavich/archive/2005/11/18/430862.aspx) late last week, the [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/ "ASP.NET") team has released a Wiki built using the Atlas controls (an AJAX library provided by [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/ "Microsoft")). You can [download it here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/asp.net/info/future/atlas_wiki/).

If you attended the Philadelphia launch event yesterday, then you already know it was a huge success. Kim Matlock did a remarkable job on this event, especially on the developer side. This was probably the best local event I've ever been to. It was cool to meet up with the other local user group leaders, such as Judy Calla (Harrisburg), Chris Waters (Allentown), and Bill Wolfe (Philadelphia). I also met some really cool people in the ATE area such as Bata (from the Team System Tools Team), Lenny Fenster (MS), Tim Edalatpour (MS), and Steve Mohr (Consultant).  
  
Now that the Philly event is complete, its time to focus on the Wilkes-Barre / Scranton Pennsylvania launch event. This event will happen at [.NET Valley](http://www.dotnetvalley.com/ ".NET Valley")'s TECHbash 2005 on November 30th beginning at 4:30pm. If you have not yet signed up for this event, please do so by visiting [**http://www.techbash.com/register**](http://www.techbash.com/register).  
  
We'll see you there!

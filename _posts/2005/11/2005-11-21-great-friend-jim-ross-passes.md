I've been "offline" the past 4 days and just heard today that a great MVP and ASPInsider has passed on. Last week, Jim Ross died after battling sickness for many months. From what I'm told, his funeral was earlier today. As many have already mentioned, Jim will always be remembered. My heart goes out to his family in this time of mourning.

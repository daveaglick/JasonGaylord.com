I just read a pretty good article on adding auto-suggest functionality to a website. The article can be found at [http://www.travelope.com/DeveloperCorner/article/](http://www.travelope.com/DeveloperCorner/article/). I have implemented a 3rd party product called [EasySearchASP.net](http://www.easysearchasp.net/), which contains similar functionality, on my [website](http://www.jasongaylord.com/). For those of you interested in seeing a common use for AJAX, be sure to check it out.

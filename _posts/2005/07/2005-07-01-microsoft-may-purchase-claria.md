[According to eWeek](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1833611,00.asp?kc=ewnws070105dtx1k0000599), Microsoft may purchase Claria, the company who owns Gator. With this in mind, eWeek has suggested that Microsoft may no longer have a strong interest in security. What do you think?  
  
Usually I try not to display my opinion on these matters, but I can make an exception. I think that if there is a deal, Microsoft can then cure 50% of their issue with spyware. This can help save them money in the long run. Also, Claria does have some value such as a customer database, user behavior-tracking software, and other small software that Microsoft could always clean up and re-use.

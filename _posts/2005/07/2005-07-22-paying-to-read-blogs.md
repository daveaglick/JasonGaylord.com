While doing some browsing this afternoon, I came across [PixelPass](http://www.pixelpass.com/). With this, bloggersÂ add "one line of code" to their template pages of their blogging engine to create an obscure image over the blog. For readers to read the blog, they must click the link and pay. Personally, I think this company is smart in doing what they are doing as I'm assuming they are one of the first ones. They'll be rich soon and laughing at me. However, I don't think you should force someone to pay just to read your blog. If that's the case, write an article and publish it somewhere. What do you think?

I've updated my [website](http://www.jasongaylord.com/) this evening. I gave it a new look and a cleaner design so I can add more content. Let me know what you think.

Also, I'd like to announce a contest that I'm holding. I've partnered with 9rays.net to offer 3 free copies of their new Report Sharp-Shooter. Beginning March 6th, go to my site to fill out the entry form. The contest will be explained at that time. It will run until the end of the month.

The [.NET Valley](http://www.dotnetvalley.com/) user group is looking for Windows and other Microsoft product presenters. We'd like to start hosting events with one .NET presentation and one general public presentation. If you are interested, please contact us at [groupleaders@dotnetvalley.com](mailto:groupleaders@dotnetvalley.com).

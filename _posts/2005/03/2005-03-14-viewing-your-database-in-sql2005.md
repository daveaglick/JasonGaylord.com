I must say that I'm very disappointed that SQL 2005 has limited the table information that you can view on a single screen. What I mean is that they have removed database diagrams from SQL 2005 and have also removed viewing the size of the columns from design view. So, if I need a screen shot of my database for a project, I need to use Visio or use Visual Studio 2005. I found it odd when I was looking for it today and found it missing. Some fellow ASPInsiders (Phil, Wally, and Paul) confirmed my findings. Its amazing how useful functionality is sometimes forgotten about while little things are never missed. ;)

I ran into an issue when installing a new version of Visual Studio 2005. I forgot to uninstall SQL Server 2005. So, the .NET Framework versions were different. This caused tons of issues leading to me not being able to have SQL Server 2005 at all on this particular machine. So, remember to uninstall everything first! ;)

The [ASP.NET forums](http://www.asp.net/forums) were updated today with the latest version of the forums software, [Community Server version 1.0](http://www.communityserver.org/). The updated software will allow Alex Lowe and the rest of the team at [Telligent](http://www.telligent.com/) to manage the ASP.NET website more efficiently. Congrats guys on a successful conversion!

Attention all developers: If you did not know that Visual Basic 6 (VB6) support ends in 2 more weeks, you should now. According to [MSDN online](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/support/vb6.aspx), VB6's "Mainstream" support will end on March 31, 2005. The extended phase will last until March of 2008. There is a ton of controversy over whether the support should continue or not. If you think it should continue, visit http://classicvb.org/petition/. Many well known Microsoft Most Valuable Professionals (MVPs) and other developers have already signed this online petition.

What's your opinion? Should support continue or not and why?

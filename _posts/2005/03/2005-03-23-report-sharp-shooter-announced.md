9Rays.Net has published a regularly scheduled version of Report Sharp-Shooter v.1.9. The new version has some improvements such as an automatic converter for quick transformation of Crystal Reports into Report Sharp-Shooter. The beta version of a new component which allows assigning formatted text with the help of tags has been added. This component also allows uploading text in RTF. The process of custom viewer and designer creation has been appreciably simplified. The PDF export filter now supports imbedded fonts. Henceforth, it is possible to export documents containing any national characters including Chinese, Japanese and any other.

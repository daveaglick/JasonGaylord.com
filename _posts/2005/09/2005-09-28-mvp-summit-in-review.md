Day 1  
  
Well, not much has happened today except for meeting some new people, seeing some old friends again, and picking up some swag. We're about to head out for our regional dinners which should be a good time to meet many others.  
  
Day 2  
  
It was cool to see the executive presentations by Steve Ballmer and crew. They talked about the direction of the company, various products, and licensing.  
  
Day 3  
  
The product group presentations were interesting. It was neat to see some of the new improvements in the .NET platform and what lies ahead for developers with Avalon.  
  
Day 4  
  
The demos of Atlas and Quartz were awesome. To see the same demos that we did, check out the videos online from the PDC this year.

This morning at the [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/ "Microsoft") PDC in Los Angelas, California (USA), [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/ "Microsoft") released its first beta of the Atlas project. Atlas is the code-named project for [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/ "Microsoft")'s AJAX (Asynchonous Javascript and XML) project. This means that you can use the tools and make server callbacks without refreshing the browser window to provide "live" updates to your pages, etc. Check it out at [http://atlas.asp.net](http://atlas.asp.net/)!

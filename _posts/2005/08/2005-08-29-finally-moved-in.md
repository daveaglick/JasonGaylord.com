Well, I'm nearly 100% moved in and unpacked. Some of the walls still look bare, but for the most part, I'm moved in. I'll be posting pictures sometime this week. Next week I'm heading on vacation. When I return, I'll have 2 hard weeks of wrapping up all loose ends before heading to Redmond to visit the gang at the [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/ "Microsoft") MVP Summit and ASPInsiders Summit. I hope to meet all of the MVPs that I have not yet met and can't wait to see all my ASPInsider friends again.

Join the Leadership Wilkes-Barre Class of 2005 in being part of the rejuvenation of Downtown Wilkes-Barre. The water fountain has been the focal point of Public Square since Wilkes-Barre was founded. Our class hopes to bring everyone in the community together to rebuild the walkway around this historic landmark. This project will not only bring safety and beauty back to public square but also restore a sense of community pride.

Donations will be recognized with engraved pavers. These pavers can bear your name or the name of a loved one. But most of all, these pavers will show that we care and that we are proud of our community. Our future and our children's future relies on concerned individuals who want to make Wilkes-Barre a better place in which to live and work.

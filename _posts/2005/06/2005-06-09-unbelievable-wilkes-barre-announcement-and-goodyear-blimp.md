Mayor Tom Leighton announced earlier this week that he had an "unbelievable" announcement for Wilkes-Barre. It turns out that it was more of an "unbelievable" disappointment. Here is the blurb from the [Wilkes-Barre Times Leader](http://www.timesleader.com/mld/timesleader/11856153.htm):  
  
> _Mayor Tom Leighton’s much awaited announcement of something “UNBELIEVABLE” coming to Wilkes-Barre turned out to be not a new business or industry for the city but instead a new marketing plan that Leighton hopes will foster a more optimistic attitude. The program centers on the phrase “I Believe...” and will seek to get people more involved and more positive about the city’s future._

In my opinion, the mayor should have waited to line-up some of the new things he looks to do in the city and then make the announcement. I will support the new attitude, but I hope there are some positive results.  
  
Anyway, the _real_ announcement should be that the GoodYear blimp flew overhead today in a rare Northeastern Pennsylvania sighting. Some that I talked to have said the last time it was overhead was in 1969. Anyway, I was able to snag a few photos and placed them on **[my website](http://www.jasongaylord.com/photos/Photos.aspx?AlbumID=60)**. Enjoy!

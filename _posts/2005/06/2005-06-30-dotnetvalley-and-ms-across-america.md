The [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/ "Microsoft") Across America tour came to Wilkes-Barre on Tuesday June 28th and brought their [tour bus](http://www.dotnetvalley.com/Photo+Gallery/311.aspx). Were you there? If not, you missed a lot of great information. Some of the topics at hand were SQL Server 2005, Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1, Web Services and Web Services Enhancements (WSE), Partner information, and more!

A few have asked how they can use [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/ "ASP.NET") 2.0 web parts with SharePoint 2003. The answer is, you really can't. They are still two different systems. In the future, they ~~should~~ will be one system. In the meantime, you can use Visual Studio .NET 2003 to develop SharePoint 2003 web parts. Follow the tutorial on creating a basic webpart: [Creating a Basic WebPart](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/spptsdk/html/CreateABasicWP_SV01003709.asp)

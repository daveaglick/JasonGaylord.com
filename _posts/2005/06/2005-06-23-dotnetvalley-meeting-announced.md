**Understanding Group Policy on Windows Server 2003 (Michael J. Murphy, [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/ "Microsoft") TechNet Presenter)**  
During this presentation, you will take an in-depth look at Group Policy, a powerful management feature of Windows Server 2003 that enables IT administrators to automate one-to-many management of users and computers, thus simplifying administrative tasks and reducing IT costs. Through the use of Policy Settings, administrators can control desktops, software deployment, and software usage and security settings across an entire organization. As this is such a powerful feature, this session covers the full range of options within Group Policy, starting by highlighting differences from previous versions. We will look at design considerations for both security and management, and then look at deploying and managing Group Policy objects using the GPMC, deploying software, testing staging, filtering, and finally troubleshooting. With GPMC, policy-based management is even easier. Administrators can efficiently implement security settings, enforce IT policies, and distribute software consistently across a particular site, domain, or range of organizational units.  
  
**Functional Network Development using [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/ "ASP.NET") (Jason N. Gaylord, [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/ "Microsoft") MVP, ASPInsider)**  
During this presentation, you will learn how to access Active Directory using [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/ "ASP.NET"). Many IT members would like to streamline their user setup process and place it in the hands of Human Resources. One of the demonstrations will show how to accomplish this. You will also see how to "ping" a computer in [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/ "ASP.NET") 1.x and how that differs in [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/ "ASP.NET") 2.x. Finally, you'll see how to screen scrape a website to obtain information. This is used most often in the event that a web service or XML feed is unavailable.

Many times I here administrators complain about outside attempts to hack their systems. In most of these cases, these same administrators continue to use Administrator as their domain admin account. I'd recommend setting up another user account and giving that account the full admin privileges. Then, disable the Administrator account. This is just one step to a more secure network.

I've been asked by many after a [recent post](http://windowsadvice.com/blogs/jason_n_gaylord/archive/2005/04/08/Microsoft_Security_Bulletin_2005_04_12.aspx)Â about MS security updates how they could find out what products are affected. You can view the security updates and narrow down particular products by visiting the TechNet Security Bulletin Search site at [http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/current.aspx](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/current.aspx).
  
For instance, choose to view all of the security bulletins for the past 2 weeks. If TechNet recently made a security posting, you will see quite a few. Then, narrow down your particular products to ensure you are secure and up to date.

With Visual Studio 2005 being released *hopefully* later this year, MSDN will change its subscription levels. The newest option is a fairly expensive one offering a full Visual Studio 2005 Team Suite. The renewal price for this option is $4598 a year. The next tier of options replace MSDN Universal. Users with MSDN Universal subscriptions will be able to upgrade to Visual Studio 2005 Team Edition for Software Architects, Visual Studio 2005 Team Edition for Software Developers, or Visual Studio 2005 Team Edition for Testers. The renewal price for each of these options is the same as the current MSDN Universal price of $2299. Microsoft will also keep the Visual Studio Professional, MSDN Operating Systems, and MSDN Library Only Subscriptions.

The [.NET Valley](http://www.dotnetvalley.com/) User Group will participate with other User Groups in the Greater PA region in attending the Greater PA MSDN Code Camp in Philadelphia this Saturday and Sunday (April 23 and 24). We look forward to meeting the various attendees of this event. If you have not signed up as of yet, I believe there are still some spots available. Be sure to visit the [.NET Valley website](http://www.dotnetvalley.com/Events/258.aspx) for more information.  
  
This event will feature 15 SQL and Data Access talks from some of the top SQL professionals including some Microsoft MVPs. The event will also host many other talks including ASP.NET and Windows Forms presentations. It will be chilly this weekend so you might as well come on out!

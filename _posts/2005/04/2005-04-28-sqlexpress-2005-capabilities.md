I posted a question to the ASPAdvice.com forums regarding the limitations of SqlExpress 2005. I already knew that there was no limitation on connections. However, [Scott Forsyth](http://weblogs.asp.net/owscott) was able to provide me with additional info. Here you go directly from the post: The database size limit is 4GB. There is also a memory limit of 1GB of RAM and a limit of 1 CPU. You can install it on machines with more than 1 CPU, but it only utilizes a max of one. There is a tool to manage SQL Express that can be downloaded from [http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/express/sql/](http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/express/sql/).

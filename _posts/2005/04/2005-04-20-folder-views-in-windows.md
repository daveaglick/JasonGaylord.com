A user requested that their Windows folders all appeared in the Detail format. Many IT users like to see each folder they browse to appear in List format. To set this, open up a folder and choose View > List. Then click on Tools > Folder Options. Click on the View tab and click the button Apply to All Folders. Its a simple task, but an annoyance to those who prefer to have their folders a certain way.

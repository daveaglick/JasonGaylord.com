I almost forgot to mention a website I came across awhile back that focuses on antivirus and security topics. It's called [AntiSource.com](http://www.antisource.com/). If you like to stay on top of security, you can subscribe to their RSS feed here: [http://www.antisource.com/backend/sitenews.xml](http://www.antisource.com/backend/sitenews.xml)

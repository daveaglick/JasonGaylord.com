According to the [GotDotNet Workspaces](http://workspaces.gotdotnet.com/) website, "Many of Workspaces' errors and access issues have been fixed, and we've upgraded to a new version of Passport." I'm not quite sure what this means :-), but I was using it last night and believe it or not (nearly 5 years later), it is much better. Kudos to the GotDotNet team for finally improving the workspaces. Now I feel like I can use them again.

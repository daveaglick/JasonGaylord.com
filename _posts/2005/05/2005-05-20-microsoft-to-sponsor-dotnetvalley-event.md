[**SIGN-UP**](mailto:attending297@dotnetvalley.com?subject=I will be attending)
As a reminder, [this event](http://www.dotnetvalley.com/Events/297.aspx) will be held at Keystone College in LaPlume, PA on May 25th, 2005 at 6:30pm. [Click here](http://www.dotnetvalley.com/Directions/default.aspx) for directions to the event.  
  
**For Consumers and Students:**
This event will feature two topics that will be useful for consumers of technology in the area. The second part of the main presentation will cover Visual Web Developer 2005 (VWD 2005). VWD 2005 is the future of FrontPage. With VWD 2005, home users, students, and hobbyists can easily create powerful websites or web applications to show off their family photos or small business. VWD 2005 comes with three starter kits to help you get started including a Personal Web Site, a Club Web Site, and a Time Tracker Web Site. After the main presentation, there will be an overview of a new Windows/Office support website called WindowsAdvice.com.  
  
**For Businesses:**
The main presentation will demonstrate how local small and medium sized businesses will be able to produce enterprise solutions in a short amount of time. Many of the new features to Visual Studio 2005 enhance rapid application development (RAD).  
  
**For IT Professionals:**
Though this event will not include a Windows/Office presentation, IT professionals will still benefit by attending. In many local businesses, IT professionals find themselves "wearing multiple hats." Visual Web Developer 2005 will allow IT professionals to develop small web applications such as Internet or Intranet sites without learning to code [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/ "ASP.NET") pages in Visual Basic.NET or C# (c-sharp). In additional, IT professionals will get an overview of a new Windows/Office support website called WindowsAdvice.com.  
  
**For Developers:**  
Developers will have the most to gain at this session. You will see many of the new features, tips and tricks, and shortcuts in using Visual Studio 2005. Later in the presentation, we will shift course and begin to talk about web development with [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/ "ASP.NET") 2.0. Again, many of the new features, controls, tips and tricks, and shortcuts will be demonstrated.

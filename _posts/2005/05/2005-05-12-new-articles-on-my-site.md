I have added my "AntiSource" articles to my website. You can check them out at [http://www.jasongaylord.com/articles/?articletype=AntiSource](http://www.jasongaylord.com/articles/?articletype=AntiSource). The articles I write on [AntiSource.com](http://www.antisource.com/) include security issues andÂ virus warnings. Some of the other authors have written reviews on hardware and software that pertains to viruses, security, logging, etc. If you've never visited the [site](http://www.antisource.com/), be sure to check it out!

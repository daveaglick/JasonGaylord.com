I finally got around to posting the pictures from the Greater PA MSDN Code Camp 2005 event in Philadelphia. They are posted on the .NET Valley User Group website at [http://www.dotnetvalley.com/Photo+Gallery/default.aspx](http://www.dotnetvalley.com/Photo+Gallery/default.aspx). Hopefully next time I can make it to both days!

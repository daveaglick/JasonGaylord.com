I just finished reading a fairly decent article about maintaining your Windows Server 2003 boxes. You can find the article here: [http://www.ftponline.com/channels/security/wss/2004\_12/magazine/features/kgardinier/](http://www.ftponline.com/channels/security/wss/2004_12/magazine/features/kgardinier/). There is a free registration to read the entire article.

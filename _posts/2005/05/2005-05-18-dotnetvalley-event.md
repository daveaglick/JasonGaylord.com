In ASP.NET 1.1, developers found themselves writing many custom controls and code snippets. Some of these tasks have now been simplified in ASP.NET 2.0 and Visual Studio 2005. Participants will see examples of using the GridView, Wizard, SiteMapPath, Menu, and Login controls. They will also understand the advantages of using Visual Studio 2005, using Code folders for websites, and using the My Namespace.

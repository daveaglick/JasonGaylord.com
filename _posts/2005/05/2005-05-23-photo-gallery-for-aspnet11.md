The first release of the [Photo Gallery](http://workspaces.gotdotnet.com/photogalleryforaspnet1x) module for [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/ "ASP.NET") 1.1 has been posted. It is a modified port of the photo gallery module that the [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/ "ASP.NET") 2.0 team wrote for the Personal Starter Kit. If you make any modifications to this download, please post your modifications to Source Control or the Message Board.  
  
A working example of the PhotoGallery module can be found at [www.jasongaylord.com](http://www.jasongaylord.com/). However, I've made some additional modifications to this site that I will be posting soon.

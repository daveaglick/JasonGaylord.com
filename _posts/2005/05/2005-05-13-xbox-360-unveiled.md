Last night on MTV, XBox 360 was revealed to the world. I don't want to take away from the new XBox, the technology, and the games, but I don't think the show was really worth it. I think that MTV did a horrible job presenting the new system. Everything they showed (with the exception of the games) can be found at [www.xbox360.com](http://www.xbox360.com/). The rest was simply fluff. For those of you who did see it, I'm sure you'd agree that all of the games looked fantastic. Kudos to Microsoft for taking the next step in the gaming world.

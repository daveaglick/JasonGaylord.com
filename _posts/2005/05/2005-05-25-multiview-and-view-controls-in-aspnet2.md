I have published an article on ASPAlliance.com about the MultiView and View controls that can be found in [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/ "ASP.NET") 2.0. In [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/ "ASP.NET") 1.x, developers often used Panel controls to hide or show a grouping of other web controls and content. In [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/ "ASP.NET") 2.x, coding time is reduced with the new MultiView and View controls.

Finally, I've added search capabilities to my site. After reviewing many [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/ "ASP.NET") search engines, I chose [EasySearchASP.net](http://www.easysearchasp.net/). [EasySearchASP.net](http://www.easysearchasp.net/) allows users to begin to type in a search phrase and see what search terms can be found in a "drop-down" box. It also is an engine that runs with the site application and does not need to be setup as a Windows Service. So, if you host your site with an ISP, it will work for you. To see how the search engine integrates with a website, visit my site at [www.JasonGaylord.com](http://www.jasongaylord.com/).

As mentioned inÂ an article written by [Rick Westmoreland of AntiSource.com](http://www.antisource.com/article.php/microsoft-onecare-antivirus), Microsoft has decided to add a more robust security application to their library. I originally mentioned that Microsoft purchased Sybari awhile ago. Windows OneCare, the new application, will span system performance, PC maintenance, data protection and security in an "easy-to-manage" service (accdg to the Microsoft.com announcement). For more information specifically about this, visit [http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2005/may05/05-13WindowsOneCarePR.asp](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2005/may05/05-13WindowsOneCarePR.asp).

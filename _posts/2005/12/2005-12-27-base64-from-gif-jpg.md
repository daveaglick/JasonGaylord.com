One of the sites I visit frequently to convert images from GIF to a Base64 string is [http://www.motobit.com/util/base64-decoder-encoder.asp](http://www.motobit.com/util/base64-decoder-encoder.asp). It's a quick and easy way to do the conversion. It would be pretty nice if VS.net eventually had a conversion tool built in.

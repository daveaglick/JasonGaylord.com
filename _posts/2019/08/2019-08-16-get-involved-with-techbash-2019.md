## Wednesday through Friday Sessions
There will be a variety of sessions on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday during TechBash. While most of the topics will have a technical focus, we're also brining in several soft skill topics this year. Our sessions are intimate giving attendees the opportunity to ask questions and obtain advice from the presenters.

## Become a Sponsor
We have a number of sponsorship levels and options, as well as a new option this year to have managed space in the main vendor hall, without requiring any onsite representation. Our [Sponsor Prospectus](https://techbash.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=699f5a552980818acd17e9293&id=603cd7445d&e=6c283ecb99)**** details many of our standard options but we also are open to other ideas.

## Build and maintain lasting relationships with top developer talent!
At TechBash, we've got a great space for networking. Vendors are centrally located in our attendee lounge - the same place we host coffee breaks and snacks. Meet attendees at your booth. Hold informal meetings in the lounge area (couches and coffee tables). Plus, at TechBash, your sponsor ticket is a full access ticket as well, so roam the halls, attend sessions, and make contacts.

## Show off what you do best! 
You are selling a product or service that benefits developers and we'll provide a space for you to demonstrate that. What works best for you? Conversations in the lounge, demos at your booth, or a 15 minute vendor session? We've got the space you need.

## Get your message out!
We offer lots of ways to get your message out. But, we also offer you the chance to be creative, so come up with your own idea and we will help you implement it!

## Show that you support the developer community.
Developers have come to appreciate that it is worth supporting companies that support their community! It's a competitive world out there but you can differentiate yourself by building a strong brand with developers by helping us deliver a great conference!

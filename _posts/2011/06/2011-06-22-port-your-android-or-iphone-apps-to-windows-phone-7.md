Did you know that your current Android or iPhone apps can be ported to Windows Phone 7? Now, there's no "easy" button that will auto-magically convert the apps for you. However, [in a post on June 9th, 2011](http://windowsteamblog.com/windows_phone/b/wpdev/archive/2011/06/09/leveraging-your-android-development-expertise-to-build-windows-phone-applications.aspx), the Windows Phone team explained how Android apps can be converted. Microsoft has provided an easy package for Android developers. The package includes:

-   [Android to Windows Phone API mapping tool](http://wp7mapping.interoperabilitybridges.com/Home/Library?source=Android)
-   [Windows Phone 7 Guide for Android Application Developers](http://windowsphone.interoperabilitybridges.com/articles/windows-phone-7-guide-for-android-application-developers) white paper, 90+ pages organized in 7 chapters

In April, the team [released an initial post](http://windowsteamblog.com/windows_phone/b/wpdev/archive/2011/04/29/leveraging-your-iphone-development-expertise-to-build-windows-phone-7-applications.aspx) explaining how iPhone apps can be ported to WP7. This package includes:

-   [iPhone to Windows Phone API mapping tool](http://wp7mapping.interoperabilitybridges.com/)
-   [Windows Phone 7 Guide for iOS and iPhone Application Developers](http://windowsphone.interoperabilitybridges.com/articles/windows-phone-7-guide-for-iphone-application-developers) white paper, 90+ pages organized in 7 chapters

More information about converting existing apps to Windows Phone 7 can be found at [http://windowsphone.interoperabilitybridges.com/](http://windowsphone.interoperabilitybridges.com/ "http://windowsphone.interoperabilitybridges.com/").

After several years of promise, I'm finally ready to deliver my new website. This website is using a combination of technologies for the web. Much of the content is formatted to use HTML 5. The base site uses a content management system called [Orchard](http://orchardproject.net). The current version of Orchard, Orchard 1.1, has been written using ASP.NET MVC 3 and the Razor view engine. Much like other CMS solutions, modules can be used to extend the functionality of the system. In my case, I decided to write a couple of modules (as well as a custom theme) to fit the needs of my website. These will be made available in the Orchard Gallery at a later date and time. I look at this new site as being a "work in progress." I'll plan on adding more content such as tutorials for Orchard and ASP.NET as well as small videos and opinions of various technologies. Be sure to check back often and subscribe to [my blog feed](http://feeds.jasongaylord.com/JasonNGaylord).

Thanks for stopping by and be sure to leave me suggestions!

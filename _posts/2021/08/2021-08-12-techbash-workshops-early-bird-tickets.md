* Jeff Blankenburg, who works on the Amazon Alexa team, will present **Building Your First Voice Experience with Alexa**. This workshop will dive right into getting setup and building a voice-based experience with Alexa. You will leave this session with a working Alexa skill that you can customize and publish as your own.

This workshop will allow attendees to dive into a Single Page Application and learn about Vue Components, router, Vuex, Axios, and ASP.NET Core. You will leave this session with an application that you can use and review.

* Chris Ayers, Practice Lead for DevOps and App Modernization, and Joe Kuemerle, Product Security Engineer for Salesforce, team up to provide two half-day workshops. The first part, **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**, will walk attendees through using actions to trigger builds and write their pipelines in YAML. The second part, **Application Security, Basic, Intermediate, Advanced**, will provide a dive into application security starting with the basics and finishing with advanced concepts.

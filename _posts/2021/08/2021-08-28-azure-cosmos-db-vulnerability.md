On August 12th, Microsoft became aware of a vulnerability in Azure Cosmos DB. The vulnerability could potentially expose the primary keys for Azure Cosmos DB data stores. It was reported through an [external security researcher](https://jasong.us/3yoqnDV) in confidence so at the time of this post, there's no known exploits of information. The discovery explained that the primary read-write keys for the account can be exposed through Jupyter notebooks. This flaw has been fixed. To regenerate your keys, you should follow the doc found on the [Microsoft site here](https://jasong.us/3sQJWUp).

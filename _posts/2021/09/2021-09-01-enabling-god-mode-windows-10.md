Windows 10 has a special mode that has been coined "_GodMode_". This mode enables several features such as administrative tools, Internet options, network and sharing center options, power options, programs and features, troubleshooting, user accounts, and more.

To get started, create a new folder on the desktop by right-clicking an empty space on the desktop and choosing folder like so:

{% include open-thumbnail.html path="2021/09/01/new-folder.jpg" alt="Create a New Folder" %}

Once the folder is created, replace the name _New folder_ with `GodMode.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}`.

{% include open-thumbnail.html path="2021/09/01/rename-folder.jpg" alt="Rename the New Folder" %}

A new icon will appear that looks like the _Control Panel_ like so:

{% include open-thumbnail.html path="2021/09/01/new-folder-icon.jpg" alt="New Folder Icon" %}

Finally, click on the new icon to load the special _GodMode_.

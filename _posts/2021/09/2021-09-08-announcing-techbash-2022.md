Last week, we had announced that [TechBash 2021 would be postponed](https://jasong.us/3zxJD37). Today I'm happy to announce that we will be back at the Kalahari next November. Here is the full post from techbash.com:

> Save the date! TechBash 2022 will return to the Poconos on Tuesday, November 8, 2022 through Friday, November 11, 2022.
> 
> The event will mark the 5th annual TechBash Developer Conference at the Kalahari Resort and Convention Center in Pocono Manor, PA. Attendees can expect more of the great content, speakers, and activities they have come to expect from TechBash. [Our newsletter](https://jasong.us/3rXsRHP) is the best way to find out the day that Early Bird tickets go on sale. Don't miss out!
> 
> Speakers can watch for our call for presentations to open early in 2022. Are you interested in speaking? [Sign up for our newsletter](https://jasong.us/3rXsRHP) to be among the first to find out when the CFP is launched. Do you know somebody who should be speaking at TechBash? Send them our way!
> 
> Thanks to all of our speakers, sponsors, staff, and attendees for making TechBash 2019 a huge success! While we had to skip 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic, we plan on making the 2022 event safe and enjoyable for all. We can't wait to see you in November, 2022!

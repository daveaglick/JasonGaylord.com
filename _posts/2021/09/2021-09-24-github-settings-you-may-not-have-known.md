GitHub is constantly adding new features and settings to help developers. While I still feel there are areas that I'd like to see more improvements, there are plenty of features that are easy to overlook.

* [Account Settings](#account)
* [Appearance Settings](#appearance)
* [Discussion](#discussion)
* [GitHub Pages](#github-pages)
* [Saved Replies](#saved-replies)
* [SSH and GPG Keys Settings](#ssh-and-gpg-keys)

### Account ###
Do you have a lot of repositories and other items tied to your GitHub account? Would someone need to manage your work if something were to happen to you? You can now add a successor to your account. This does not override and legally binding next-of-kin, estate laws in your jurisdiction, or a binding will. However, if those are not present, this will help GitHub allocate the resources to your successor.

### Appearance ###
Back in December last year, I posted about [GitHub's Dark Theme](https://jasong.us/2K6AdXF). There are now 4 different themes. In addition, you can set the theme to adjust based on day or night using the `Sync with system` option.You can also set your preferred emoji skin tone preference. Just recently added, you can set the tab size preference. The default value is set to 8.

### Discussions ###
You can now hold conversations about your repository in a new repository setting called _Discussions_. Simply visit your repository and click on the _Settings_ option. By checking the box you'll see a new _Discussions_ area in the repository.

### GitHub Pages ###
While GitHub Pages still runs on an old version of Jekyl, they did move GitHub Pages to its own tab. Hopefully this is a sign that you'll soon be able to configure more from this tab. 

### Issues ###
The Issues functionality still leaves much to be desired. However, you can now lock a conversation, pin an issue, transfer an issue, convert an issue to a discussion, or hard delete an issue.

### Saved Replies ###
If you frequently reply to comments in GitHub, you can add pre-defined replies using the _Saved replies_ settings. Simply add a title that and a description.

### SSH and GPG Keys ###
If you sign commits using security keys, there is a new feature called _Vigilant mode_ that you may want to check out. This mode will flag unsigned commits as unverified.

I recently updated the [Upcoming Events](https://jasong.us/events) page on my site to include over 85 developer and technical events for the rest of December and all of 2022. 

{% include link-thumbnail.html path="2021/12/07/dev-events-page.jpg" alt="Dev and Tech Events for 2022" url="https://jasong.us/events" %}

If you are looking to plan which events you are attending in 2022, be sure to check out the calendar at [jasong.us/events](https://jasong.us/events). 

There are still major events that we do not have dates for as of yet. Here is what to expect beyond the list I've provided thus far:

- Amazon events such as AWS re:Invent
- Apple events such as WWDC
- CIO 100
- Dell Technologies World
- E3
- Google events such as Google I/O
- IBM events such as the CIO Leadership Summit
- Microsoft events such as Build, Ignite, and the MVP Global Summit
- Mobile World Congress Los Angeles
- Samsung events such as Unpacked

In May 2020, I [had announced](https://jasong.us/3fBMNtn) a new Jekyll theme called [SpaacedOut](https://jasong.us/2ywUm3C). Since that time, I've made a couple of updates for [a 1.1.x version](https://jasong.us/3ehYK5i) and just recently added some additional changes for a 1.2.x version. Those changes in the latest round of updates include:

- Added the theme version number in a `version.html` include file that is placed in the footer and can be referenced in the application
- Updated the tags and archive to `smartify` single and double quotes
- Added a target for header links that are added to the menu
- Updated classes for notices so we can have difference styles for `<blockquote>` and `<blockquote class="notice">`
- Force the `rouge` highlighter

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/spaacedout.svg)](https://jasong.us/3bp45GJ)

To install this theme, you have two options:

1. [Install using the spaacedout gem](https://jasong.us/3fBMNtn#install-using-the-spaacedout-gem)
2. [Install using it as a remote theme](https://jasong.us/3fBMNtn#install-using-remote-theme)

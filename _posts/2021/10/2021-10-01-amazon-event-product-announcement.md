Amazon's fall device announcements were released earlier this week. There are plenty of interesting devices announced this week and a few that were [mentioned again](https://jasong.us/3tuacEn) from the earlier web announcements from earlier in September.

Here is the list of announcements from this week:

### Amazon Astro ###
[Amazon Astro](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078NSDFSB?pf_rd_r=C0YPT9HRS67ZBPG9KBYB&pf_rd_p=d27034fe-8279-4f2d-bb7d-ebb64b0b38ae&pd_rd_r=f567b20e-c419-4085-b135-126cab77b706&pd_rd_w=0gPxx&pd_rd_wg=8tW1U&linkCode=ll1&tag=jasongaylor01-20&linkId=4ca5385466a18e2f423cf167926131c4&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) is Amazon's new smart robot for home monitoring and security. While Amazon introduced the new robot, this new device seems to only scratch the surface with what a smart robot can do. Amazon has ambitious plans for this device to include arms to be able to bring things to you and can even pair with another new announcement, Amazon Together, to help elderly. This product has no release date, but is currently listed for a Day 1 Edition price of $999.99.

### Echo Show 15 ###
The Amazon [Echo Show 15](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MQLDFF6?pf_rd_r=C0YPT9HRS67ZBPG9KBYB&pf_rd_p=ab75c7a3-4bd8-4d42-af82-0fbddd8573ee&pd_rd_r=f567b20e-c419-4085-b135-126cab77b706&pd_rd_w=xy26K&pd_rd_wg=8tW1U&linkCode=ll1&tag=jasongaylor01-20&linkId=9a1615f5e5c23fea84ceeac914526950&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) is probably my most favorite announcement this week. Like the other Echo Show devices, the Echo Show 15 is a 15" interactive display. However, this device can stand like a picture or mount flat to a wall. This device is currently not available, but is listed at $249.99.

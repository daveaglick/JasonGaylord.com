Visual Studio 2022 [launches](https://jasong.us/3BE34s9) on November 8th, 2021 at 11:30 am ET, 8:30 am PT. 

### Features
There are [several upgrades](https://jasong.us/3vaTESH) with the latest version. Probably the most touted is that Visual Studio will run as a 64-bit application. This means that you will no longer be bound to the 4GB limitation of a 32-bit application. The reality is that many of us probably hit the memory limits at one time or another.

The Visual Studio team has also spent quite a bit of time focused on updating icons for better clarity, legibility, and contrast. There's a new fixed width font called [Cascadia Code](https://jasong.us/2XcJ0yg) that was originally bundled with Windows Terminal, but now is available in Visual Studio as well. It allows various font weights, italics, and cursive in a fixed font. 

.NET 6 and .NET MAUI are fully supported within Visual Studio 2022. You can also use pre-built GitHub workflows and actions to build your applications using CI/CD. 

Again, check out all of the upgrades by visiting the team's blog post at [jasong.us/3vaTESH](https://jasong.us/3vaTESH).

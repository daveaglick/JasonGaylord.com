Even before we had to cancel TechBash 2020, the TechBash Foundation advisor team has been working towards TechBash 2021. We're very concerned of the well being of our attendees, speakers, and everyone involved in TechBash but also very hopeful and optimistic that we can have a safe and fun event this October. Last week we posted an update on [techbash.com](https://jasong.us/tb):

> Last February (2020), the organizers of TechBash were in the midst of planning their 5th straight regional software and web developer conference. We all felt that we were ahead of the game and making great strides to make our event even better than previous years. However, the event never took place due to the pandemic that caught nearly everyone by surprise.
> 
> Today we'd like to announce that TechBash will return to the Pocono Mountains in October. Our goal is to host a safe and enjoyable conference for all. We are hopeful and optimistic that the wide-spread effects of COVID-19 will continue to diminish over time. As we approach the event, if we feel that our attendees, sponsors, presenters, colleagues and friends will be placed in harms way or will not have an enjoyable time, we will reconsider the 2021 event.
> 
> We will be sharing additional information in the weeks ahead including the opening date for registration. For now, save the date, continue to be safe, and get ready for the return of one of the best regional conferences around, TechBash 2021.
> 
> We'll see you in October!

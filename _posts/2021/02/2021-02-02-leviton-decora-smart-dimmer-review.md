I'm starting to slowly replace my outlets and switches in my house from the classic beige, almond, ivory, off-white, or whatever color they call this:

to clean white. It's just time. These switches just look worn and the little on/off words show dirt now matter how hard you try cleaning them. I figured if I was upgrading, I might as well try to stay within the same brand and add a few smart switches. Since most of my house has Leviton, I decided to start using Leviton smart switches.

The [Leviton DW1KD-1BZ Decora Smart WiFi switch](https://amzn.to/3j9sXYz) is a 1000W Dimmer that allows you to dim incandescent bulbs or also support 450W LED dimming. There is no hub required, unlike some other popular light switches as it works with WiFi. The My Leviton app works with Alexa and Google Assistant so you should not have any issues connecting with your other smart devices. 

Now, for the bad. This specific smart WiFi switch requires a neutral wire. If you do not have a neutral wire, you will not be able to use the Decora smart features as the smart features and LED light require it. Secondly, if you use Apple HomeKit, there's a separate Decora switch that you'll need to purchase. Sure you can use IFTTT, but that can get a bit messy as you're relying on yet another 3rd party. If you're using a newer WiFi 6 router, such as the [eero Pro 6](https://jasong.us/37Wy7mS) I wrote about in December, you'll have to temporarily disable the 5GHz network in the software. 

So, while I wasn't able to replace all of my dimmer switches with the new Leviton Decora Smart Dimmer, I was able to replace some of them. You can find dimmers from Leviton, Lutron, and others that do not require a neutral wire. Rather, they will connect using Z-Wave or another technology.

Overall, on a scale of 1.0 to 10.0 where 10.0 is the highest, here are my scores:

Leviton also has a [600W Dimmer](https://amzn.to/3tgOIdE[), [plug-in dimmer](https://amzn.to/2MOpqm8), and a [voice dimmer with Alexa built-in](https://amzn.to/3tbPicF).

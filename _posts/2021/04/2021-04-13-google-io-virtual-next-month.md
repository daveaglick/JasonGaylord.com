Google I/O is back for 2021 and will take place virtually from May 18-20. The I/O conference is free for everyone to attend. Connect with developers from around the world at this year's virtual Google I/O for thoughtful discussions, hands-on learning with Google experts, and a first look at Google's latest developer products. 

To register for the event, visit the event page at [events.google.com/io](https://jasong.us/3wNTu3T).

In addition, I've updated many events on [my Events page](https://jasong.us/events). Some events through the end of June have switched from in-person to digital events. However, it sounds as if more events are planning on sticking with in-person events starting in July.

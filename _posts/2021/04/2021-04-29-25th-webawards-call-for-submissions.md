The 25th annual International WebAward Competition Call for Entry is open. The deadline for submissions is May 28th, 2021. This year, 97 industries will have a winner selected. For as long as I can remember, I've been a judge for the WebAwards. I enjoy judging the contest each year to see which categories have made the most advances in technology. I'd highly recommend checking it out. You can find past winners by industry by visiting [jasong.us/3eBmjbB](https://jasong.us/3eBmjbB).

Also, you can register for the competition by visiting [jasong.us/3dVUWtK](https://jasong.us/3dVUWtK).

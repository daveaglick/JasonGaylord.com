["Coding the Coal Region"](https://jasong.us/3aaMKDM) is a project sponsored by the Greater Wyoming Valley Chamber of Commerce, W/B Connect, codelicious, The Institute, and PennState Wilkes-Barre. The project's purpose is to increase the computer programming skills in Northeast PA by providing students with access to curriculum, training, and certification modules to meet the immediate workforce needs of the computer programming industry. The group offers FREE online, instructor-lead courses to students in grades 6-12 that attend schools in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania.

The next sessions will begin the week of May 10th and go through the week of August 16th. Students will attend two hours of class per week over the course of 14 weeks. There is a one-week vacation break built into each course. 

If you participate in the program, I'd be interested in hearing the experience you have had.

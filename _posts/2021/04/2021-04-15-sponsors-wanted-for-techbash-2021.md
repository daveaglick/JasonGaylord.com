The sponsor prospectus is now available for TechBash 2021. You can get the details of the prospectus on the TechBash website at [techbash.com/#Sponsors](https://jasong.us/3mL7IOF).

We have many options for sponsors this year and are thrilled to be back in person this October. If you are unfamiliar with the event, the event takes place in the Pocono Mountains at the Kalahari Resort & Convention Center. This year's event will take place October 19-22, 2021. The Kalahari is a great place for families to hang out as well. We highly recommend bringing them and allowing them to enjoy the water park, arcade, and other amenities the Kalahari and the Pocono Mountains have to offer. We have discounted rooms available.

For full details be sure to check out [techbash.com](http://jasong.us/tb).

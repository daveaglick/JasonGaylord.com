The Microsoft Small Business Solutions team is at it again. There will be several events in the Mid-Atlantic region through March of 2009 that will have some content. You can find out more by visiting the official website at [http://sbstechnologymakeover.com](http://sbstechnologymakeover.com).

Kudos to Michael Murphy and the rest of the SBS team for getting this together.

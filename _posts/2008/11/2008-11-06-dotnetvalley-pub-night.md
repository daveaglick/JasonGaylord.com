Join the MSDN Team (Lindsay Rutter, Dani Diaz, and David Solivan) and the rest of [.NET Valley](http://dotnetvalley.com/events/eventdetails.aspx?eventid=67) for the "Best Wings" in the area. On November 13th, we'll be meeting at the new Quaker Steak & Lube found in Dickson City. The evening will begin at 6pm. .NET Valley will be sponsoring some Wings and beverages.

If you are going to attend, we need you to register as soon as possible so we can give an accurate count to the restaurant. Register today at [dotnetvalley.com](http://dotnetvalley.com/events/eventdetails.aspx?eventid=67)!

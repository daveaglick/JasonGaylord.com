The Microsoft .NET Framework received a new logo and a revised site recently. The new logo can be found at [http://blogs.msdn.com/sayanghosh/archive/2008/10/26/new-net-logo.aspx](http://blogs.msdn.com/sayanghosh/archive/2008/10/26/new-net-logo.aspx "http://blogs.msdn.com/sayanghosh/archive/2008/10/26/new-net-logo.aspx"). The new site can be found at [http://www.microsoft.com/net/](http://www.microsoft.com/net/ "http://www.microsoft.com/net/"). Nice logo! It's very slick and fits within the other modern day Microsoft logos.

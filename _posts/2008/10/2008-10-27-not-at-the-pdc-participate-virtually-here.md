So I'm not going to be at the Microsoft PDC this year primarily because of all the work I have to catch up on. However, I can participate virtually at [NotAtPDC.com](http://notatpdc.com/). If you're going to be at the PDC, be sure to blog about it and tweet your URL to [@NotAtPDC](http://www.twitter.com/notatpdc). Also, there will be other virtual presentations and such that will be done throughout the week. I'm likely going to do a talk tomorrow sometime. We're still ironing out the details.

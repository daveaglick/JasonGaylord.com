[Scott Guthrie](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/) announced yesterday that Silverlight 2 has been released. Rather than reposting everything he stated, you can read his original [post here](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/10/14/silverlight-2-released.aspx). Here are a few links to note:

Hope this helps to get you started using Silverlight 2.

Finally, I always wondered what their reach was with Silverlight. According to their press release, 1 out of every 4 already has Silverlight installed: [http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/oct08/10-13Silverlight2PR.mspx](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/oct08/10-13Silverlight2PR.mspx "http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/oct08/10-13Silverlight2PR.mspx")

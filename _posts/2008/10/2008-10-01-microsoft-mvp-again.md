I just received word that I've been awarded with the Microsoft MVP award for ASP.NET for 2009. I've been a Microsoft MVP since 2003. It's always nice to receive the MVP award, but it's even better to see the impact that you have on the community. Six years ago, Northeastern Pennsylvania had no user group. In fact, most developers and IT professionals had no idea that Microsoft had a new .NET Framework. Things have changed. Many companies now use the framework and our user group has expanded to include IT professional and open source content. We've hosted events at our area's best colleges and universities including Scranton University, Penn State – Lehman, and Luzerne County Community College. We've held an annual event called TechBash that has had as many as 125 at the event. I need to thank the community for this award. I hope we continue to grow technology in the area.

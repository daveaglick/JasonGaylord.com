Stephen Walther has posted a great list of [Visual Studio 2008 Tips and Tricks](http://weblogs.asp.net/stephenwalther/archive/2008/10/21/essential-visual-studio-tips-amp-tricks-that-every-developer-should-know.aspx). I found 3 or 4 that I didn't realize when checking out his post. The two I'll likely use the most are number 1 and 3. Great stuff Stephen!

DevExpress and Microsoft [announced](http://community.devexpress.com/blogs/ctodx/archive/2008/10/27/coderush-xpress-announced-and-available.aspx) a partnership today to offer CodeRush Xpress for free. At the present time it's only available for non-express versions of Visual Studio and will only work with C# (per their post). I'm sure the other support will be just around the corner. If you're interested be sure to [download Xpress here](http://devexpress.com/Products/Visual_Studio_Add-in/CodeRushX/).

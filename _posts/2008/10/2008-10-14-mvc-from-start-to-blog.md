I gave a talk this past weekend at the [Philly.NET](http://phillydotnet.org) [Code Camp 2008.3](http://phillydotnet.org/Default.aspx?tabid=682). I've uploaded my [slide deck](http://jasongaylord.com/downloads/MVCStartToBlog.zip), [project](http://jasongaylord.com/downloads/SimpleBlog.zip), and a [few additional files (used in the demo)](http://jasongaylord.com/downloads/20081011-MVCTalkSupportFiles.zip) in case anyone would like to review again. I was also able to find another way to fake HttpContext. Check out Stephen Walther's blog post about [faking the controller context](http://weblogs.asp.net/stephenwalther/archive/2008/06/30/asp-net-mvc-tip-12-faking-the-controller-context.aspx). He also has a blog post about [unit testing the views without a web server](http://weblogs.asp.net/stephenwalther/archive/2008/07/26/asp-net-mvc-tip-25-unit-test-your-views-without-a-web-server.aspx).

I hope all that attended enjoyed my talk and I look forward to seeing you all again!

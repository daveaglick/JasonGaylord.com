The IE team posted a blog entry yesterday at [http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/09/08/microsoft-css-vendor-extensions.aspx](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/09/08/microsoft-css-vendor-extensions.aspx "http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/09/08/microsoft-css-vendor-extensions.aspx"). Apparently they are now going to support certain CSS properties and attributes to comply with CSS 2.1 by tagging them with -ms-. For a full list, be sure to visit the blog link above.

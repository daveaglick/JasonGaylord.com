**2:23pm** - Ben is demonstrating the sliding tabs in the browser. Tabs can be reordered or moved to another instance of the browser.

**2:28pm** - Chrome will learn your favorite searches for instance hitting 'A' and 'tab', it will allow you to search amazon.

**2:30pm** - The 9 most visited sites will be on the main tab page. It will also show your bookmarks, favorite searches, and recently closed tabs.

**2:35pm** - Option called Create Application Shortcut. This basically creates a shortcut on the desktop that hides all of the toolbars and allows the shortcut to open with no toolbars.

**2:38pm** - Each process runs independently and allows each tab to render separately.

**2:42pm** - Each plug-in will be its own process. So, if you are on a page that you need to visit and the plug-in doesn't work, you can kill the plug-in and continue browsing.

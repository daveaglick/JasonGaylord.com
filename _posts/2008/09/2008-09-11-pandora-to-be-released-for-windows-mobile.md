The full letter from Tom Conrad, CTO of Pandora, is available at [http://wmpoweruser.com/?p=627](http://wmpoweruser.com/?p=627 "http://wmpoweruser.com/?p=627"). Basically, Tom has stated that a version for Windows Mobile devices will be coming out, but he refuses to guarantee when. One would assume it would be sooner rather than later and would hopefully support WMV 5, 6, and 6.1.

If Tom or anyone is looking for a beta tester... :)

Mary Jo Foley posted a summary of the first Microsoft advertisement that played during tonight's NFL game. Her full blog posting can be found at [http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=1569#comments](http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=1569#comments "http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=1569#comments"). For those of you that want to see the video, here it is:

Anyway, I must agree. While it did have an old Seinfeld humorous twist, it didn't really advertise the company. What did you think? On a scale of 1-10 where 10 is the best, I'd give it a 4. There was no negativity towards Apple which is a plus, but the lack of Microsoft products being pushed kept it below a 5.

**UPDATE**: Now that I think about it more, I'm sure the upcoming advertisements will have to relate to this one in some sense. If not, it's a waste of $300 million that could have been spent on improving some products.

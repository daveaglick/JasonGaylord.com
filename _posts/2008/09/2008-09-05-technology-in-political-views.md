I usually don't like mentioning anything political in my blog. However, this I found interesting. BetaNews has written several entries regarding the democratic and republic president and vice-president candidates. Here they are in order of publish date:

- Joe Biden - [http://www.betanews.com/article/Where\_does\_Joe\_Biden\_stand\_on\_technology\_issues/1219872202](http://www.betanews.com/article/Where_does_Joe_Biden_stand_on_technology_issues/1219872202 "http://www.betanews.com/article/Where_does_Joe_Biden_stand_on_technology_issues/1219872202")
- Barack Obama - [http://www.betanews.com/article/Where\_does\_Barack\_Obama\_stand\_on\_technology\_issues/1219956705](http://www.betanews.com/article/Where_does_Barack_Obama_stand_on_technology_issues/1219956705 "http://www.betanews.com/article/Where_does_Barack_Obama_stand_on_technology_issues/1219956705")
- John McCain - [http://www.betanews.com/article/Where\_does\_John\_McCain\_stand\_on\_technology\_issues/1220563425](http://www.betanews.com/article/Where_does_John_McCain_stand_on_technology_issues/1220563425 "http://www.betanews.com/article/Where_does_John_McCain_stand_on_technology_issues/1220563425")
- Sarah Palin - Coming on September 5th

What do you think of their reviews?

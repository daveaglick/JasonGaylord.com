Many developers, including myself, have installed the initial beta of Google Chrome. However, downloaders beware. There is a new vulnerability (or old depending on how you look at it) with Google Chrome. For more information, check out the full ZDNet article at [http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=1843&tag=nl.e539](http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=1843&tag=nl.e539 "http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=1843&tag=nl.e539").

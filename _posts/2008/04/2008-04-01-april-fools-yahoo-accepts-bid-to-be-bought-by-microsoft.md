I just noticed that my RSS feed reader had a new posting from InfoWorld about Yahoo accepting a bid to be bought out by Microsoft. The URL contains the words "april" and "fools" and it would make sense as I believe they have pulled a stunt like this before. However, to someone who may forget the day of the year, this may seem like a believable story. Here it is:

I like the whole employee compensation section with Microsoft giving an Xbox and Zune to all employees they decide to retain. It's a nice touch.

I needed Copy Source As HTML support in Visual Studio 2008. Luckily I came across [this post](http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/bursteg/archive/2007/11/21/copy-source-as-html-copysourceashtml-for-visual-studio-2008-rtm.aspx) today with a walk-through to set it up in VS 2008. I can't wait for Microsoft to get this into Visual Studio. Too bad there wasn't a Windows Live Writer add-on for it.

I was reading a post by [Michael Arrington](http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/04/06/comcast-twitter-and-the-chicken-trust-me-i-have-a-point/) about his enjoyable weekend and learned something. It has nothing to do with chickens. I always knew there were services that archived Twitter posts, but I was never satisfied with anything I found until this... [Tweet Scan](http://tweetscan.com/). It's a great service. By all means check it out!

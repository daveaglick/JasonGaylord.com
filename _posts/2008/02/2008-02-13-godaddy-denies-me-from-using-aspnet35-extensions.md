I have a domain that I was going to use for a little while as I attempt to sell my home. I registered it with GoDaddy knowing they have .NET support. However, I should have read a little further into the shared hosting specs. Apparently, GoDaddy only supports ASP.NET 1.1 and 2.0 and does not support any of the later frameworks. I sent them an email asking them if there was a box they could move me to that had 3.5 and they said no and that it's "not something we are planning on implementing at this time." Surely I'm confused. Oh well. I guess I'll have to move it elsewhere. That turned me off of doing any business with GoDaddy in the future.

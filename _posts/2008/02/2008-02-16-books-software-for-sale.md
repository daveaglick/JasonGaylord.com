I'm in the process of doing some early spring cleaning and I'm really cleaning out my closets. I've got lots of books and software I'm going to begin listing on Amazon ([http://www.amazon.com/gp/shops/index.html?ie=UTF8&sellerID=A3HIQ7PK69ITYM](http://www.amazon.com/gp/shops/index.html?ie=UTF8&sellerID=A3HIQ7PK69ITYM)) and at eBay ([http://search.ebay.com/\_W0QQsassZjasonngaylord](http://search.ebay.com/_W0QQsassZjasonngaylord)). If you're interested, feel free to ping me directly.

I just read a post from [Steve Andrews about Visual Studio](http://www.platinumbay.com/blogs/dotneticated/archive/2008/03/18/happy-visual-studio-birthday.aspx). Little did I know that Visual Studio 97 came out on March 19, 1997. So, technically, today is VS's birthday. How cool is that? Steve even posted the original mission for VS 97. Funny how its very similar to today's purpose.

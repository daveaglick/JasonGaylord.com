IE8 Beta 1 now forces CSS 2.1 along with other web standards (includes some early HTML 5 stuff too!). I'm creating a list of websites that seem to be broken by the browser. Feel free to leave a comment if you come across other sites. Here's what I found so far (notice that only part of the site may be broken and not necessarily all of the site):

- http://dell.com (missing menu bar at the top and bottom)  
- http://cnn.com (textbox at the bottom on the page)  
- http://nbc.com (content layout)  
- http://yahoo.com (search bar)
- http://asp.net (content layout)
- http://gm.com (where's the content?)
- http://officemax.com (missing some menu in the left column)
- http://homedepot.com (some elements are not aligned properly)
- http://news.com (items not aligned properly)
- http://facebook.com (main page)

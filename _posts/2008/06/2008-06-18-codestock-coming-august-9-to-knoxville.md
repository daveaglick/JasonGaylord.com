CodeStock is coming August 9th to Knoxville, Tennessee and you should see the speaker line-up! Jeff Prosise will present the opening keynote and Alan Stevens will mediate the open spaces. There's a ton of great presenters that will be at CodeStock including Steve Andrews, Rachel Appel, James Avery, Jason Follas, Amanda Laucher, Chris Love, Wally McClure, Jeff McWherter, and more! Be sure to check out the agenda at [http://codestock.org/Pages/Agenda.aspx](http://codestock.org/Pages/Agenda.aspx "http://codestock.org/Pages/Agenda.aspx") and register for the event today!

UPDATE: Unfortunately, I won't be able to present or attend CodeStock due to a prior engagement. Hopefully Steve Andrews and Rachel Appel can still attend and make Pennsylvania proud.

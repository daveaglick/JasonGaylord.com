Sonu Kapoor just posted about getting started with the [AjaxDataControls in Visual Studio 2005](http://dotnetslackers.com/Community/blogs/sonukapoor/archive/2008/06/13/ajaxdatacontrols-adc-faq-how-to-get-started-with-the-ajaxdatacontrols-with-visual-studio-2005.aspx). The AjaxDataControls can be found on CodePlex at [http://www.codeplex.com/AjaxDataControls/](http://www.codeplex.com/AjaxDataControls/ "Releases"). Included in the controls are a JavaScript version of the Repeater, DataList, and DataGrid. If you'd like to have AJAX functionality over your data with minimal coding, I'd definitely check this out.

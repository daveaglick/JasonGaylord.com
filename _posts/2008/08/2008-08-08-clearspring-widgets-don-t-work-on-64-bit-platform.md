Unless you are using IE 32-bit, don't expect the Clearspring widgets to work. [Clearspring](http://www.clearspring.com/) is one of the leaders in building widgets for social networks and Vista. The reason their widgets do not work is because Flash is not yet supported on 64-bit platforms. By default, the Vista Sidebar on a 64-bit system displays widgets by using IE 64-bit.

An example of a Clearspring widget in the [2008 Beijing Summer Olympics widget](http://www.nbcolympics.com/widgets/index.html) from NBCOlympics.com.

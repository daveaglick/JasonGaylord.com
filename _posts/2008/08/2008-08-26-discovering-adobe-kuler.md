[Chris Love](http://professionalaspnet.com/Default.aspx), [posted a tweet](http://twitter.com/ChrisLove/statuses/899296087) today about Adobe Kuler. Kuler is a web/flash based application that allows developers and designers to upload and download color swatches for Adobe Photoshop. It's a great way, as Chris put it, for developers to pick up color schemes/themes.

Thanks for the post Chris!

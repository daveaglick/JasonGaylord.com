I was just checking out the improvements the team has made in beta 2 of Internet Explorer 8. While I haven't had time to mess with all of the improvements, I see lots of opportunities to create enhancements for my sites to allow visitors to get what they are looking for faster. Be sure to check out the full list of improvements at [http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/08/28/part-i-better-everyday-browsing.aspx](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/08/28/part-i-better-everyday-browsing.aspx "http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/08/28/part-i-better-everyday-browsing.aspx").

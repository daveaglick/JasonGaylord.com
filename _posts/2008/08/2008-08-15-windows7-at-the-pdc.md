Sounds like Windows 7 might be previewed at the PDC. If not, significant details will surely be shared. No, I didn't escape one of the Microsoft buildings with their business plan but rather came across the team's new blog at [http://blogs.msdn.com/e7/](http://blogs.msdn.com/e7/ "http://blogs.msdn.com/e7/"). The first posts were yesterday (August 14th) and I'm sure more posts will be coming soon. Be sure to check it out!

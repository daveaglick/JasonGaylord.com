I've been quite busy working on a side project in which I'll post more details very soon. However, I came across the two latest ASP.NET Podcasts in which I thought I'd share:

-   [Caching with ASP.NET 3.5 SP1](http://aspnetpodcast.com/CS11/blogs/asp.net_podcast/archive/2008/12/04/asp-net-podcast-show-129-caching-with-net-3-5-sp1.aspx)
-   [ASP.NET AJAX with JQuery](http://aspnetpodcast.com/CS11/blogs/asp.net_podcast/archive/2008/12/03/asp-net-podcast-show-128-ajax-with-jquery.aspx)

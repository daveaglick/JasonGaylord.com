The TECHbash 2008 session schedule has been released. Registration begins at 7:30am. During the registration period, a continental breakfast will be served in the dining room. The keynote presentation by Joe Stagner will begin at 8:30am with breakout sessions to follow. Lunch will take place at noon in the dining room and we may have some activities going on during that time. The final breakout sessions will take place after lunch with a presenter Q&A following that. To wrap up the event, we will be holding a raffle. Some raffle prizes will require that you are present to win. More details about the raffle prizes, our "Pick-A-Prize Auction", and our SWAGbags will be announced next week.

Xobni went public recently offering it's beta tool for download at [http://xobni.com](http://xobni.com). Xobni, inbox spelled backwards, is an add-on for Microsoft Outlook. I've been using it with Outlook 2007 for quite some time and appreciate it's usability. I like being able to click on an email to review all emails to and from that particular user and to also see their contact info. I'd like the ability to edit their contact info if it was incorrect, but I'm sure that will be added in the future. If you haven't used it yet, be sure to check it out.

I found a great post which summarizes aggregate functions in LINQ. It includes examples for Average, Sum, and Count. Check it out at [http://www.dev102.com/2008/04/16/how-to-use-aggregate-functions-with-linq-to-sql/](http://www.dev102.com/2008/04/16/how-to-use-aggregate-functions-with-linq-to-sql/ "http://www.dev102.com/2008/04/16/how-to-use-aggregate-functions-with-linq-to-sql/"). As always, you can test your functions by using LINQPad which is available at [http://www.linqpad.net/](http://www.linqpad.net/ "http://www.linqpad.net/").

You can now download an add-on for Microsoft Word that supports DAISY XML, the Digital Accessible Information System standard for accessible translation. The add-on reads the word document to individuals. Like most accessibility projects, there are still some bugs that need to be worked out. If you're interested in testing the add-on, please visit [http://tinyurl.com/5txl7a](http://tinyurl.com/5txl7a).

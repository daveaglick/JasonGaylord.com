According to Gizmodo, the iPhone 3G launch date will be June 9th. It will be interesting to see what further market share the iPhone will capture with this latest phone.

It will also be interesting to see what phones other providers will release to compete with the iPhone. For more details, visit [http://tinyurl.com/5pe7pc](http://tinyurl.com/5pe7pc).

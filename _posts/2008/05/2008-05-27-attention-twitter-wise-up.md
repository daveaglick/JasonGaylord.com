I read through the [Twitter blog](http://blog.twitter.com/) from time to time just to see how things are going. Apparently, things aren't going good. Pagination and IM updates have been temporarily disabled and something has caused my twitter utilities (twhirl and OutTwit) to cease function. I keep getting an error that shows "Rate limit exceeded. Clients may not make more than 30 requests per hour." Can you imagine if Twitter was an eCommerce shop and stopped a viewer after 30 page views? They'd slowly lose business. Does the Twitter team get that?

What about the limit of 140 characters? I know plenty of folks have complained about that. If you add a few individuals to your response, you'll soon notice that you're down to 100 characters. If you don't understand short hand or Internet lingo, forget it. So this would be like going to the grocery store with a limit of $14. Hope you can get everything you need.

I'd really like to see Twitter merge with another social networking app like Facebook or FriendFeed. I'd even be ok with Microsoft, Apple, or Google purchasing them.

Before I forget, I might as well drop a line to my social profiles: [Twitter](http://twitter.com/jgaylord), [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/people/Jason_N_Gaylord/712216359), and [FriendFeed](http://friendfeed.com/jgaylord).

Have you visited dell.com yet today? Dell is 24 years old. Sometimes when you deal with a company for so long, you forget about some of the good (and bad) things that they have done in the past. It's nice to use these lists when you reconsider that company or look for another one. Dell has provided a "24 reasons to use us" list at [http://tinyurl.com/5uawpa](http://tinyurl.com/5uawpa). They've also provided a link to the top PC shippers in the world and the US. Those statistics can be found at [http://tinyurl.com/4bx683](http://tinyurl.com/4bx683 "http://tinyurl.com/4bx683").

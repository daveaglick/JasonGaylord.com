This has "bugged" me for awhile. When you log into any version of SQL (2000, 2005, and even 2008) as a user with restricted access to just a single database (or even a few databases), you can still see a complete list of all the databases on that server. There have been times when I needed to share a database with a customer or have accessed a shared database at a host such as DiscountASP.net or GoDaddy and can see all of the customers on that one box. It's more of a nuisance than a real threat but I really wish it was changed. It has been confirmed as a bug.

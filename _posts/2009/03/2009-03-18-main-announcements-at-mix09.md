[Channel 10 has posted a great summary](http://on10.net/blogs/sarahintampa/Microsoft-Web-Technology-Announcements-from-MIX09/) of the announcements from today's MIX 09 events. One of the items that they didn't post is that [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) MVC 1.0 has been released. Be sure to check it out!

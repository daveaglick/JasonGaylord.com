I don't get an opportunity to use [Microsoft](http://microsoft.com/) Expression Web that often, but when I do, I always discover new features. I was looking for a way to compress HTML and JavaScript files that I was generating for one of our affiliations. In Expression Web, simply go to Tools > Optimize HTML to see a list of options. Just remember to resave your files as a different name in case you remove comments unless the comments can be lost. If you need to take a .min file or a compressed file and see a more fluent version of the source, you can right-click in the source window and choose Reformat HTML to reformat the source.

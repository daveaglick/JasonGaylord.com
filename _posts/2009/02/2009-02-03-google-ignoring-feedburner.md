It appears that Google is ignoring [Feedburner](http://feedburner.com/) and the customer base that comes along with it. Google is in the process of forcing customers to switch their feed syndication from Feedburner over to Google, however, they seem to have some issues and don’t seem to be answering the [questions](http://groups.google.com/group/feedburner-services/browse_thread/thread/57b38940ebcbd6e7) [being](http://groups.google.com/group/feedburner-services/browse_thread/thread/0f03112097d8658d?hl=en) [posed](http://groups.google.com/group/feedburner-services/browse_thread/thread/e6ac5f4f4d6ffcad?hl=en) [by](http://groups.google.com/group/feedburner-services/browse_thread/thread/7bffd0cfde4e8065?hl=en) [Feedburner](http://groups.google.com/group/feedburner-services/browse_thread/thread/8cb778a2a3664d4c/e3d9463996a84787?hl=en&lnk=raot#e3d9463996a84787) [customers](http://groups.google.com/group/feedburner-services/browse_thread/thread/baf3462297a83d75?hl=en). I have [an issue where after migration the MyBrand functionality stopped working](http://groups.google.com/group/feeds-and-syndication/browse_thread/thread/aa1f547285f2e473?hl=en&q=Jason+Gaylord). I’ve tried using their funky CNAME value for my feed, but that doesn’t seem to work. According to the response from the community on my question, I need to change it to a generic CNAME value. Who knows how long this will work (or if it will). I wish Google would stop ignoring the Feedburner customers.

[Exceptioneer](http://www.exceptioneer.com/) is a product created by Pixel Programming. Phil Winstanley, one of the founding members of Pixel Programming, recently sent me an invitation to try out Exceptioneer. No pun intended, their concept and product is exceptional! It's really easy to setup and is a great way to log exceptions and review them visually. They include a code snippet, stack trace, have a direct link to Google to search for a potential solution, and allow you to share the summary with others without giving them access to your application. To see it's current capabilities, take about 10 minutes to view their [overview video](http://www.exceptioneer.com/Public/Demonstration.aspx).

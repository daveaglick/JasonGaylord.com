I received Telerik's monthly newsletter this morning and noticed that they've added [support for ASP.NET MVC to their AjaxControls](http://blogs.telerik.com/AtanasKorchev/Posts/08-11-06/ASP_NET_Ajax_Controls_in_ASP_NET_MVC.aspx). Now they've taken it a step further to produce an [MVC forums application](http://demos.telerik.com/mvc) using their control suite. If you are a Telerik subscriber, you can [download their demo application](http://www.ixfr.com/?id=gngnlh&C=gej&R=feflmehm_fnmn&E=ifei&P=ijk&J=gnhje&L=1) from their website.

Ok. So for years now I've been using [TechSmith](http://www.techsmith.com/)'s [Camtasia Studio](http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.asp). I've always thought their software was great to dictate and record the screen. Now they've gone completely silly. Oh, and I mean in a good way. About two weeks ago I asked their Evangelist Activities Coordinator, Kristina, about their support for editing MP4 files. It was quite simple. I just picked up a new [Flip MinoHD camcorder](http://www.theflip.com/) and wanted to edit the clips I recorded in Camtasia by inserting screencasts. At the time, she told me I couldn't do it. So, I converted my video using Adobe Premiere Pro. I got this bloated piece of junk out and into Camtasia. It ended up working for what I needed, but I was very disappointed.

Earlier today, TechSmith announced [Camtasia Studio 6.01](http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia/upgrade/upgradepost.asp?t=&purchased=6.0.0&license=single) which provided this functionality. They've also cleared up 99% of the open issues in the product. I've never witnessed a video editing software that loads, captures, edits, and saves as fast as this. I'd give this 6 stars out of 5!

Here is what is included in the Camtasia Studio 6.01 maintenance update:

**General:**
- Added the ability to include and edit .MP4 files on the timeline.
- Added the ability to include and edit TechSmith video .SWF files on the timeline.
- Added a short-cut key for a "Play from beginning" control in the Editor preview window.
- Added a Help menu option in Editor to allow online registration of the product after it has been purchased.
- Added the Audio Setup dialog into Camtasia Recorder.
- Added an option to change the key frame interval for MP4 productions.
- Added an option for changing from a bit rate encoding setting for MP4 to a quality encoding setting for MP4 productions.

**Studio:**

- Fixed an issue with undo requiring multiple steps to undo a single step when using a hotkey for transitions or callouts.

- Fixed an issue with auto-save not working when moving a project from Windows XP to Windows Vista or from Windows Vista to Windows XP.

- Fixed an issue when choosing a single video with TOC template would cause callouts not to be shown in the produced video.
- Fixed some indexing issues in the AVI file format that could cause unexpected editing results, incomplete productions or corrupt projects.
- Fixed a crash that could occur when entering a very large duration for Title Clips.
- Fixed an issue that would cause PiP clips to be placed at the start of the timeline instead of where it was supposed to be placed.
- Fixed an issue that was causing the first frame to not be displayed correctly on Screencast.com.
- Fixed an issue that would cause the last folder used would not be recalled and used correctly when uploading to Screencast.com.

- Fixed an issue that would cause the audio clips to stop responding to move commands on the timeline.

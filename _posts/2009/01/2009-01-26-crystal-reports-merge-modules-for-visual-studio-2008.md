Since [SAP purchased Business Objects for $6.7 billion in 2007](http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/3703886), Crystal Reports deployment for Microsoft Visual Studio has become more difficult to deploy. Instead of choosing a built-in merge module, you now much visit the [SAP site and download the necessary files](http://service.sap.com/sap/bc/bsp/spn/bobj_download/main.htm) for your environment.

I guess itâ€™s time to begin moving reports over to a different format.

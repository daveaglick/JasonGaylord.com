First off, congratulations to the Microsoft ASP.NET team for their hard work on the MVC out-of-band releases over the past few months. It's nice to see these OOB releases on Codeplex. Earlier, [Scott Guthrie announced](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2009/01/27/asp-net-mvc-1-0-release-candidate-now-available.aspx) that the team has released the [ASP.NET MVC 1.0 RC1](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=141184&clcid=0x409). A release candidate is very similar to an RTM release except for the fact that a few minor bugs still may be fixed between the current release and RTM. Scott has a list of the new features in the [RC on his blog](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2009/01/27/asp-net-mvc-1-0-release-candidate-now-available.aspx). Be sure to check it out!

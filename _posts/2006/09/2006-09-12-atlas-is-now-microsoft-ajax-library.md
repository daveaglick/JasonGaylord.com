Scott Guthrie has just announced the Microsoft "Atlas" road map and name on his blog. Be sure to read the full details [here](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/09/11/_2200_Atlas_2200_-1.0-Naming-and-Roadmap.aspx). Besides the name, the best thing to get out of his post is that the Microsoft AJAX Library will be released for version 1.0 sometime before Christmas. How cool is that?

Yesterday, Microsoft introduced 2 new Visual Basic 2005 power packs. The first power pack will allow developers to create .NET forms and use them from within their VB6 applications (very cool). The second will make it easy to print VB forms without having to write too much code. Cool stuff. Also, if you visit the site, you can suggest power packs for the team to create.

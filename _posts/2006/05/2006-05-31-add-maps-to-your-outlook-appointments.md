Microsoft Live now has an add-in for Outlook to allow directions and maps to be added to Outlook appointments. You can even send the maps and directions along with the appointment. You can download the add-in by visiting [http://office.microsoft.com/search/redir.aspx?AssetID=XT101641041033&Origin=HH101650561033&CTT=5](http://office.microsoft.com/search/redir.aspx?AssetID=XT101641041033&Origin=HH101650561033&CTT=5).

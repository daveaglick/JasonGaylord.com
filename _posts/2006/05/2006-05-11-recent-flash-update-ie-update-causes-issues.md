In case you were unaware, any website using Flash or any other embedded object that interacts with the user will now prompt the user asking them to "Click to activate this control." It seems as though its going to be a big pain. If anyone found a way to get around this (although I'm sure its a security risk), short of uninstalling the update, let me know.

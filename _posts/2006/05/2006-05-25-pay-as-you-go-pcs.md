I'm not sure who came up with this idea but apparently Microsoft is working with a few other companies such as Lenovo and Intel to create a Pay as You Go service for PCs. This new service is called [FlexGo](http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/flexgo/). There are a few ways that FlexGo would work. What do you think about this type of service?

[Scott Guthrie](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/05/29/Eliminating-CSS-Image-Flicker-with-IE6.aspx) pointed out some good tips to resolve an issue that occurs with images stored in CSS. [Russ Helfand](http://www.groovybits.com/leftoverbits/flickerfix.aspx), who works on his team and has done some cool things such as an AJAX wiki and the CSS adapter kit, has a really cool solution by caching the images by using a handler.

Wally McClure and Paul Glavich, both ASPInsiders, run the unofficial [ASP.NET Podcast](http://www.aspnetpodcast.com/). Each week a new "episode" is released where someone from the ASP.NET Podcast team usually interviews a few peers about upcoming technology, tips and tricks, etc. Be sure to check it out and subscribe to the [RSS feed](http://www.scalabledevelopment.com/ftp/ScalabilityWithDotNet.xml).

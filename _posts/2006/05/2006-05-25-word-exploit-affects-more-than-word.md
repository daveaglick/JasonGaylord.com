Little did I realize yesterday that when I posted the blog entry about the Microsoft Word exploit that this exploit does in fact affect other applications. In our organization one of our departments utilizes an application that uses Word for reporting capabilities. Since it merges data from a Pervasive SQL database, the easiest way for them to setup the reporting capabilities was by creating a macro library. However, the library needs access to things such as a network share, folder structures, and file permissions. So, these users needed Word's macro security set to low. If we force all users to use MS Word in safe mode, these macros will not run. I wonder what other apps are affected? I didn't try running safe mode yet with Microsoft Small Business Accounting, but I wonder if the Word reporting works in safe mode with SBA? SBA uses smart documents.

One of the items on my list of things to do was to create a vsi file for easy installation of a custom snippet library we had created. Since I never had to create a VSI file before and I remember that some ASPInsiders questioned the VSI file back around Beta 1 because there were some issues, I really wasn't sure how easy it would be to create one. Then I found a great tutorial on MSDN called [How to: Package Community Components to Use the Visual Studio Content Installer](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms246580.aspx). It's definitely a great resource to build VSI's.

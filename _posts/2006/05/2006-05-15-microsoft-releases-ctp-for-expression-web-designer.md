I just noticed that Microsoft has released the first Community Technology Preview (CTP) for the [Expression Web Designer](http://www.microsoft.com/products/expression/en/web_designer/wd_free_trial.aspx). The Expression Web Designer allows designers to build standards-based Web sites, includes sophisticated CSS-based layouts, includes extensive CSS formatting and management, and provides rich data presentation. You can download it now and report any bugs to the team using [http://connect.microsoft.com/](http://connect.microsoft.com/).

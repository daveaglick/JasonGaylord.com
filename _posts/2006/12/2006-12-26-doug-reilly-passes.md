This past Saturday, Doug Reilly, a great friend and colleague of mine, passed away. My prayers go out to his family and friends in this time of grief especially being so close to the holiday season. He will be missed by all who knew him. His full obituary can be found at [http://www.app.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2006612240457](http://www.app.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2006612240457).

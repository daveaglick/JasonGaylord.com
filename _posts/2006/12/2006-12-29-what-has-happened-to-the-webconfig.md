I'm working on a web project that will utilize the Microsoft AJAX Library and asked myself, "What has happened to the web.config file?" I mean, back in ASP.NET 1.0, I was lucky if my web.config file was 20 lines long. Now, I'm finding myself commenting the web.config file to remember why I added, changed, commented, or removed items. How pathetic is that! &lt;g&gt;

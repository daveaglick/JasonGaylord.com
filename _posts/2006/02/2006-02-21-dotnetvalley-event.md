**An Overview of the Patterns & Practices Enterprise Library (Peter Laudati, [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/ "Microsoft") Developer Evangelist)**  
Sick and tired of writing the same old plumbing code? How many times do you find yourself writing the same 10 lines of ADO.NET code?! Wish you could agree on and share best practice implementations within your organization? Then the [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/ "Microsoft") patterns & practices Enterprise Library might be just what the doctor ordered!  
  
The patterns & practices Enterprise Library is a library of application blocks designed to assist developers with common enterprise development challenges. Application blocks are a type of guidance, provided as source code that can be used "as is," extended, or modified by developers to use on enterprise development projects. Enterprise Library features new and updated versions of application blocks that were previously available as stand-alone application blocks. All Enterprise Library application blocks have been updated with a particular focus on consistency, extensibility, ease of use, and integration.  
  
Enterprise Library 1.1 was released in June 2005, targeting the .NET Framework 1.1. A new version, Enterprise Library 2.0, was recently released in January 2006 targeting the new .NET Framework 2.0 and Visual Studio 2005.  
  
An overview of each of the Enterprise Library 1.1 blocks will be given, followed by some deep dive samples on a couple of the blocks. We’ll take a sneak peak at what’s new in the 2.0 blocks too. Also covered will be a review of pros & cons of using [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/ "Microsoft") application blocks, as well as block futures.  
  
**Upgrading to SQL Server 2005 ( Michael J. Murphy, [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/ "Microsoft") TechNet Presenter)**  
Grab the knowledge you need to upgrade an existing SQL 7.0 or SQL 2000 server to SQL Server 2005. We’ll look at the [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/ "Microsoft") SQL Server 2005 Upgrade Advisor, which you can use to prepare for the new upgrades. Your existing SQL Server instance can be upgraded by using either a migration process, which involves installing SQL Server 2005 on a new server and then migrating data, or through an in-place upgrade that updates your existing installation. We’ll tackle the techniques and benefits of both processes, so you can find the best fit.

I posted the question on the ASPAdvice.com technical list and received a response from a good friend, Paul Murphy. His solution is documented at [http://aspadvice.com/blogs/pmurphy/archive/2005/02/09/2084.aspx](http://aspadvice.com/blogs/pmurphy/archive/2005/02/09/2084.aspx). I haven't tried it yet, but it just might work. Looks like I'll have to try it sometime soon.

I saw a post come around about some cool XBox 360 Tracker resources. Check these out:

- [360 Tracker](http://untitlednet.com/), a WinForms app to find stores in any area with 360s in stock. Will alert me via email and my cell phone as well as on my computer screen.
- [xbox360tracker.com](http://xbox360tracker.com/), a web site that shows online sales and their in-stock status. Available as an RSS feed
- [NotifyWire.com](http://www.notifywire.com/), a web site that will filter for online sales in my price range and notify me via email and SMS.

I'm selling two domain names I've had for awhile. They are courseknowledge.com and courseknowledge.net. I have them up on eBay, but if anyone is interested in them, ping me. You can view my eBay listing on [these here](http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=220004416042&ru=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.ebay.com%3A80%2Fsearch%2Fsearch.dll%3Ffrom%3DR40%26satitle%3D220004416042%26fvi%3D1).

In this show, Wally interview John Papa. You can download this latest podcast at [aspnetpodcast.com](http://aspnetpodcast.com/CS11/blogs/asp.net_podcast/archive/2006/07/21/349.aspx).  
  
Also, be on the lookout for a future ASP.NET Podcast show where I interview Julie Lerman. I did the interview last night. Every time I meet up with Julie somewhere I find out something new and interesting.

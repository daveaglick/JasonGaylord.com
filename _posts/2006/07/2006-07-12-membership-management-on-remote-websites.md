I was reading a [post by Richard Dudley](http://www.rjdudley.com/blog/remote%20web%20administration%20tool.aspx) earlier regarding membership management on remote websites. He mentioned a tool that seems to be pretty useful and costs $59. That's not bad at all for users who don't have the time or desire to whip up a membership console themselves. However, minus the AJAX enabled interface, it's not that difficult. During my talk at Philly.net back in May, I discussed different ways to manage roles and membership.

I'm not saying I approve this, and usually I wouldn't post this stuff, but this is funny. I live about 30 minutes from Hazleton, home of Lou Barletta. In Hazleton they have new laws regulating illegal aliens and immigrants. If you'll be offended by this I'm really sorry. Please don't read any further if this is the case.

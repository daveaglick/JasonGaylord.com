HD Moore, a popular hacker, has recently updated his controversial exploit framework called [Metasploit Framework](http://metasploit.com/). This framework has plug-in modules to allow users to test everything from their browsers to their operating system and from certain applications to their web server. One of the most interesting modules is the CSS exploit module in which HD Moore created a web test for. You can try out the test [here](http://metasploit.com/users/hdm/tools/see-ess-ess-die/cssdie.html).

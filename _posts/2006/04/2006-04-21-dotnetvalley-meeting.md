The next [.NET Valley](http://www.dotnetvalley.com/ ".NET Valley") meeting will be held on Wednesday April 26th at [Luzerne County Community College](http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?city=nanticoke&state=PA&address=1333+south+prospect+street&zip=18634&country=us&zoom=5) in [building 7, room 703](http://www.luzerne.edu/about/campusmap.pdf). The event will begin at 6pm.  
  
Presenting for [.NET Valley](http://www.dotnetvalley.com/ ".NET Valley") will be Chris Leeds, a local [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/ "Microsoft") MVP of FrontPage. Chris will be presenting 'FrontPage 2003 Part 3 - Using FrontPage to Deploy a Shopping Cart.' Chris will demonstrate just how easy it is to deploy an ASP (Active Server Page) and  MS Access driven shopping cart by leveraging some of FrontPage's lesser known features. Chris will then follow-up by "skinning" the cart using FrontPage and CSS (Cascading StyleSheets).

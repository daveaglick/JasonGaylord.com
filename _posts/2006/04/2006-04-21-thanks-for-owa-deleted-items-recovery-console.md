What a great feature the OWA deleted items recovery console is for Exchange 2003. The fact that you can recover emails with just a click is awesome. The only issue that I see is that I think Administrators should allow or deny this access on a mailbox level. There are some users (such as basic users), who when terminated will just delete all of their email from the console as well thus forcing IT admin to restore email from backup if necessary.

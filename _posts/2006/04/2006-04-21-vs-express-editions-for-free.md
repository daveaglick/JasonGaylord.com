I'm just catching up on some things today which is the reason for all the blogs. I came across an entry from one of the RSS feeds I subscribe to pointing me to a [press release](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/apr06/04-19VSExpressFreePR.mspx) by [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/ "Microsoft") on April 19th. According to the press release, the Visual Studio Express editions (including Web Developer, SQL Express, etc), will be **FREE** forever! Furthermore, you can now develop applications to work with LEGOs. How cool is that? You can download the SDK for developing on LEGOs by [clicking here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun/lego/default.aspx).

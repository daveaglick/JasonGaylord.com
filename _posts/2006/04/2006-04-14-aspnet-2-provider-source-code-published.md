Scott Guthrie [announced](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/04/13/442772.aspx) that his team has released the [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/ "ASP.NET") 2.0 provider source code. This is very cool stuff especially if you want to see what they did for providers such as profile, membership, etc. Thanks for posting that Scott!

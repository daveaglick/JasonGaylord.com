I just enabled my RSS feeds listed on DotNetSlackersÂ to auto-post entries from any of my 3 blogs to [Community Credit](http://www.community-credit.com/). If you are not familiar with either, DotNetSlackers is a tool that [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/ "ASP.NET") developers can subscribe to (for free) to receive all of the latest news in the [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/ "ASP.NET") community in an email each day. Community Credit gives out "stupid prizes to smart people." In other words, if you do lots of community work such as blogging, attending user group meetings, presenting, writing articles, etc, you have a really good chance to win some funny and cool tech prizes. If you're not a member of either yet, be sure to sign-up today!

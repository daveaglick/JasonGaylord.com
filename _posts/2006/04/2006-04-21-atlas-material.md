Wow! I just realized how much material the [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/ "ASP.NET") team has posted on Atlas. There are [videos](http://atlas.asp.net/default.aspx?tabid=47&subtabid=478) demonstrating certain features of Atlas. There are [blogs](http://atlas.asp.net/RssAggregated.ashx?mid=474) listing upcoming events, how-to's, and upcoming features. Then there are the [forums](http://atlas.asp.net/RssAggregated.ashx?mid=1986) wher users and the [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/ "ASP.NET") team collaborate about Atlas. If you haven't checked this stuff out yet, be sure to check it out soon. In addition, one of my good friends, Wally McClure (<sigh>I guess I'll admit it</sigh>), is soon releasing a book called '[Beginning AJAX with ASP.NET](https://amzn.to/2MmA3JB).' From what I hear, it should be pretty good.

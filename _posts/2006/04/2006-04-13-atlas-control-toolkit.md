In case you have not heard yet (as I tend to find out about things a bit late thanks to the amount of email I get), the Atlas Control Toolkit has been released and is up for download on the [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/ "ASP.NET") website. You can download the toolkit at [http://atlas.asp.net/default.aspx?tabid=47&subtabid;=477](http://atlas.asp.net/default.aspx?tabid=47&subtabid=477). The toolkit includes some cool controls such as a Collabsable Panel, HoverMenu, PopupControl, and more. Full demos of each control are also available on the site.

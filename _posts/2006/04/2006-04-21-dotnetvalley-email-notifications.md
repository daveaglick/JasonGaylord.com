Our old data center lost our [.NET Valley](http://www.dotnetvalley.com/ ".NET Valley") database containing the list of email addresses that were part of our group. Unfortunately, they also had corrupt backup tapes as well. Since this issue, we switched data centers and I must say our new one is much, much better. However, we still do not have everyone's email added to our list. If you are interested in being par of the [.NET Valley](http://www.dotnetvalley.com/ ".NET Valley") User Group email list, be sure to sign-up by [clicking here](http://www.dotnetvalley.com/subscribe.aspx).

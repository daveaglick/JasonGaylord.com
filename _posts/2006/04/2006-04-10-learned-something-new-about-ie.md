Yesterday I learned something new about IE. I read a post by [Scott Guthrie](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/04/09/442332.aspx) talking about a cool new feature in [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/ "ASP.NET") 2.0 called App\_Offline.htm. I already new about that feature, but I didn't know something else he mentioned. If you create an error page that does not show at least 512 bytes, IE 6Â will show the "friendly" error message that is built in. Interesting. Thanks Scott!

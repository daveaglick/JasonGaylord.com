Do you still use the DHTML ActiveX editing control in your web pages or application? If so, you may want to reconsider. When Vista is released, Microsoft will mark that control as obsolete. To read more about this, check out the MSDN article at [http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnlong/html/htmleditinfuture.asp](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnlong/html/htmleditinfuture.asp).

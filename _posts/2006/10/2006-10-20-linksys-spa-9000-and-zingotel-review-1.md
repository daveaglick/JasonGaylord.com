Yesterday we installed a Linksys SPA-9000 Small Business phone system in one of our newly acquired remote offices. The office will only have up to 3 people in it at any time, so we stayed with the 4 phone system instead of the 16. We chose ZingoTel for our service provider. Initially, I was a bit skeptical because its difficult to get to a person to talk to there and finally, when you do, their phone is breaking up. However, they walked us through the installation yesterday step-by-step. Our phones came online in less than 30 minutes. We made a few phone calls and the clarity was perfect. Today we noticed that we've had an issue with our phone lines, but I'm not sure why that has occurred. We're looking into it now which is why this is review 1.

Yesterday I switched advertising systems from Google AdSense to Lake Quincy Media. What a difference! The quality of advertisements is 10 times greater than what I had before. Google's AdSense system was intelligent, but failed miserably on my site. 90% of the ads were related to blog or photo sites because blog and photo are in my menu. I now have advertisements specific to my site's purpose. Thanks to Steve Smith and the rest of the crew at [Lake Quincy Media](http://www.lakequincy.com/) for getting my setup.

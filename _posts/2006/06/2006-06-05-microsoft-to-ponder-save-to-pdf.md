According to [Mary Jo Foley at Microsoft Watch](http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,2180,1971047,00.asp), Microsoft may ponder removing the Save to PDF option in theÂ 2007 Microsoft Office System. Personally, I hope they don't remove it. Adobe should understand that there should be other benefits to having Adobe Acrobat Standard or Professional besides saving documents as PDF. Right now, for the common IT professional or office user, there are very few. Eventually, people will stop purchasing Acrobat just for that reason whether Microsoft includes the Save to PDF option or not.

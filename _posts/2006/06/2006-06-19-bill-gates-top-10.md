Now that Bill Gates has decided to step down, Mary Jo Foley from Microsoft Watch has put together a list of the "Top 10 Flops of the Bill Gates Era." You can read about them [here](http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,2180,1977870,00.asp). I think the two that stand out the most in everyone's mind (even Microsoft employees that worked on or around these teams) are numbers 1 and two.

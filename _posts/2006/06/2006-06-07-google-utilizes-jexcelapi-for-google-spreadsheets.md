Google released [Google Spreadsheets on June 5th](http://windowsadvice.com/blogs/jason_n_gaylord/archive/2006/06/06/Google_Spreadsheet_Announced.aspx). One of the features of Google spreadsheets is to export and import Excel (xls) files. Google has accomplished this rather easily by using the [Java Open API for Excel](http://jexcelapi.sourceforge.net/). After messing with it in my test account, its a pretty cool utility for uploading and creating spreadsheets in a pinch, but its definitely not a replacement for Excel.

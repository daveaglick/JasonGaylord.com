Within the past 3 years, Google has taken aim at Microsoft and visa versa. Nearly all services and/or planned services have been countered by the other. Here is a current (as of this post) list comparing Microsoft and Google products:

<table>
    <tbody><tr>
        <th>Microsoft</th>
        <th>Google</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>MSN Search</td>
        <td>Google.com</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>MS Office</td>
        <td>StarOffice</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Hotmail</td>
        <td>GMail</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>MSN Toolbar</td>
        <td>Google Toolbar</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Windows Desktop Search</td>
        <td>Google Desktop</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Windows Live Messenger (MSN IM)</td>
        <td>Google Talk</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Local.Live.Com</td>
        <td>Local.Google.Com</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Virtual Earth</td>
        <td>Google Earth</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>MSN and Live.com</td>
        <td>Personalized Google</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Office Live</td>
        <td>Google Page Creator</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Windows Live Shopping</td>
        <td>Froogle</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Vista/Live.com Gadgets</td>
        <td>Google Dashboard Widgets for Mac</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Script#</td>
        <td>Google GWT</td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>
  
The two most recent are the [and](http://pages.google.com/) [Nikhil Kothari's Script#](http://www.nikhilk.net/ScriptSharpIntro.aspx). I created a [sample Google Pages site](http://jason.gaylord.googlepages.com/) and for most GMail users (non-technical), it might work. However, there is almost no functionality.  
  
The only thing that Microsoft has on Google (as far as products, not necessarily quality, etc) is the XBox and XBox Live.

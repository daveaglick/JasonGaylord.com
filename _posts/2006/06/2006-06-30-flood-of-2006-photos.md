Wow! We definitely got lucky. I have placed three flood albums on my site. Many of the best pictures aren't online because we were more worried about saving valuables, houses, and stores that we didn't have time to break and take pictures. Between sand bags and wet shoes, I was able to snap a few:

- [6/28/2006 Album 1 - Day after Hicks Creek Crested](http://www.jasongaylord.com/photos/Photos.aspx?albumID=140)
- [6/28/2006 Album 2 - Susquehanna River Rises](http://www.jasongaylord.com/photos/Photos.aspx?albumID=141)
- [6/29/2006 - Evacuation Notice, Reason My House Still Exists, etc.](http://www.jasongaylord.com/photos/Photos.aspx?albumID=142)

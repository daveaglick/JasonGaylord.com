Unfortunately I will not be at TechEd to hang out with any of my friends (which I can probably count on one hand ![Smile [:)]](http://aspinsiders.com/emoticons/emotion-1.gif)). Fortunately, I will be sitting on a beach somewhere enjoying no cell phone or laptop. I will probably check in with the TechEd folks later in the day each day but I won't be checking email regularly. To all who will be in Boston, have fun and maybe I'll run into you very soon.

Ironically, [my DSL problem](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgaylord/archive/2006/06/01/Off-Topic_3A00_-Verizon-DSL-Support-Is-Horrible.aspx) was solved before I received my modem. I guess that I'll just have to use my nice new modem now since they still believe its a modem issue. Isn't it funny how they'd trade $160 modem for a full month's DSL credit (at a max $29/month)? They could have given me the next 3 months of DSL for free and would have saved them $70. Unbelievable. Oh wait, yes it is -- it's an "infamous" telco. Other than this issue, I've never had a single issue with my Verizon DSL. I just wish they'd start "upgrading" their support!

[Wally McClure and I](http://morewally.com/cs/blogs/wallym/archive/2006/06/05/47.aspx) were talking about a [blog post by Dave Rosenburg](http://weblog.infoworld.com/openresource/archives/2006/06/while_matt_is_y.html) this morning. Apparently, Dave thinks that ASP.NET is a resource hog because it cannot perform using a Virtual Machine or Virtual Server. Instead, he suggested hosting an ASP.NET application on a linux/UNIX box much like the [MainSoft offering](http://www.mainsoft.com/). How crude is that? :)

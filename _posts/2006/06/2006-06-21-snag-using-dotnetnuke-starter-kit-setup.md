It must not be my week at all. I was trying to build the VB.NET addition of DotNetNuke Starter Kit 4.3, but ran into a snag. Apparently, DNN could not load type `DotNetNuke.Modules.Forum.AttachmentPage` in `Forum\Forum_Attachment.aspx`. It's probably a common error (at least I hope it is), but I'll have to do some research.

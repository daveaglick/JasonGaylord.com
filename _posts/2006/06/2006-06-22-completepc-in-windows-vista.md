For some time now I thought it would be nice for Microsoft to offer a backup application that will completely back up the entire PC. Well, now it looks like they have. The feature is called CompletePC Backup. From what I have heard from others, you can also remove the SID information from the backup to allow imaging. If that's the case I can finally use just Windows instead of Windows and DriveImage (others may still use Ghost).

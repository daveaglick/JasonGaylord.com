For those of you that are familiar with the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton area of Northeastern Pennsylvania, be sure to visit [www.wnep.com](http://www.wnep.com/) for pictures and river levels. Up to this point, no storm in the history of the Wyoming Valley has been more devastating to low-lying and mountains in this are than this storm. The creek behind my house is still 5 feet below the first floor level. However, folks in the "Back Mountain" region aren't so lucky. The Huntsville Damn by Penn State Lehman is being watched carefully as there may be a potential breech in the damn wall. The river is supposed to crest at or around the stage of the 1972 Agnes flood.

I'll be posting pictures as soon as I can. Until then, I'm staying afloat.

As a reminder, the call for speakers for TechBash 2023 is open now through April 11th, 2023. That's right. There's only two weeks left in the CFP. The event takes place in Pocono Manor, PA this November 7-10.

We are currently seeking sessions, workshops, keynotes, and family day session proposals through our Sessionize link. Full details can be found at [techbash.com/#CallForSpeakers](https://jasong.us/tbcfp). 

This event will be the 6th installment of the TechBash Developer Conference, each being held at the Kalahari Resort. Attendees can expect great content, speakers, and activities as they have come to expect from TechBash events [Our newsletter](https://jasong.us/3rXsRHP) is the best way to find out when tickets will go on sale. Don't miss out!

Thanks to all of our speakers, sponsors, staff, and attendees for making TechBash 2022 a huge success! While we had to skip 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic, we bounced back and had a safe and enjoyable event in 2022. We plan on making this event, TechBash 2023, even better! We can't wait to see you this November 2023!

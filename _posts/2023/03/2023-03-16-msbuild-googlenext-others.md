Microsoft Build announced that it will be in person this year, along with a digital experience. The event takes place in May with pre-conference sessions happening on May 22nd and the main conference taking place from May 23rd through May 25th. 

Google Next will also be in person this year. THere are limited tickets available, but Google Next will be back at the Moscone Center in San Francisco at from August 29-31. 

There have been several other events added to my tech event calendar. If you have an event that I'm missing, feel free to contact me on Twitter, Mastodon, LinkedIn, Facebook, or by submitting a [pull request through GitHub](https://jasong.us/39JIVEO). 

In addition to the bigger, corporate conferences, there have been a few others added too. If you've never had the opportunity to attend [Stir Trek in Columbus, OH](https://jasong.us/3FkjzxG), I'd highly recommend it.

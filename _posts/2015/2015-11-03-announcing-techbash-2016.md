A couple of years ago, a few developers in the community talked about hosting a new developer conference in the Northeastern US. Over the past six months, after several discussions with the [CodeMash](http://jasong.us/1kpu6ep) team, we turned the talk into action. Yesterday, the TECHbash Foundation announced that next September 28-30, 2016, we’ll be hosting the first annual [TECHbash](http://jasong.us/ikRRKi) event at the brand new [Kalahari Resorts and Conventions Center](http://jasong.us/1kpu06P) in Pocono Manor, PA. This location event is less than 2 hours from New York City and Philadelphia and around 4-5 hours from Washington DC and Boston. For the first year, we’re planning on capping the registration at 400 attendees.

If you’re interested in participating, please visit our landing page at [http://techbash.com](http://jasong.us/ikRRKi). If you’d like to talk to us more about it, feel free to reach out to one of our TECHbash Foundation board members on Twitter.

While many businesses across America and throughout the world are struggling to survive COVID-19, one business that has remained open throughout the years is still pulling through. That business is [Blockbuster](https://jasong.us/2Y5z4Vc). Yes, the last Blockbuster video store located in Bend, Oregon is still open. In a [blog post](https://jasong.us/3aCKGBL) on April 21st, the store announced that it will continue to be open daily from 11am until 6pm and requires patrons to follow the arrows in the aisles and maintain social distancing. In addition, you can request curb side pickup.

**UPDATE: This library now supports .NET Standard as opposed to .NET Core.**

I have recently updated the MarkdownSharpCore library to support .NET Core 2.2 and now .NET Standard. The source code for the library can be found on GitHub at [https://github.com/jasongaylord/markdownsharp](https://jasong.us/3bKE7OS). You can grab the NuGet package here: [https://www.nuget.org/packages/MarkdownSharpCore](https://jasong.us/2KLHf1i).

MarkdownSharpCore allows you to present Markdown in the browser as HTML. There are a few applications that go the other route including [Html2Markdown](https://jasong.us/2YhbpRO).

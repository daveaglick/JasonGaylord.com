Since video games allow socializing through the platform, Google has decided to offer their Stadia gaming platform [free for the next two months](https://jasong.us/2Rv8G2Y) across 14 different countries. Stadia is an online gaming platform that is competing with Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon. Stadia offers both mobile and browser play. You can also use any desktop, laptop, tablet, and Android smartphone. It also supports playing on your TV through a Chromecast Ultra. 

There are several controllers compatible for your device. Check out the listing of [controllers here](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?k=Stadia+controller&ref=nb_sb_noss_2&linkCode=ll2&tag=jasongaylor01-20&linkId=5ae4befe4be6eb89e33b08e591d3c299&language=en_US).

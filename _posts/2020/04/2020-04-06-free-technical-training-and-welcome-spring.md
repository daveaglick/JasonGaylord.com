In today's post, I'd like to highlight two key things:

1.  [Pluralsight's Free Month of Technical Training](#pluralsight's-free-month-of-technical-training)
2.  [Spring is here](#spring-is-here)

## Pluralsight's Free Month of Technical Training
For the entire month of April, Pluralsight is offering all of their 7000+ expert-led video courses for free. They're calling this initiative #FREEapril. 

If you haven't heard of Pluralsight before, they are a company that provides technical training covering Software Development, IT Operations, and Information & Cyber Security. 

You can find out more about this offer at [https://jasong.us/pluralsight](https://jasong.us/pluralsight). 

## Spring is Here
The first day of Sprint occurred back on Thursday, March 19th, but with everything going on, you may not have had a chance to let that soak in. It's a beautiful time to be outside and enjoy the weather. Go for a walk, observe nature, and if you have kids, use it as a great time to show and explain what's happening outside. You may see bees pollinating flowers, snakes and groundhogs finding their place, or bright blue skies overhead. It's a great way to take a moment and relax. In fact, on nice days, change your work environment scenery such as working outside from a covered porch or under a patio umbrella so you can still see your screen. Just ensure that if you're on a call, you keep the outside noises to a minimum. Here are four pictures I took from a midday walk:

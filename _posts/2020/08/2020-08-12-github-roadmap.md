GitHub has published their roadmap for GitHub.com and GitHub services. You can see what's upcoming through the first quarter of 2021 and beyond by visiting [github.com/github/roadmap/projects/1](https://jasong.us/2PFnP0f). I think I was most surprised not to see a migration from GitHub Pages to Azure Static Web Apps. GitHub is definitely looking to continue to expand what's available in GitHub Actions by enabling them for GitHub Enterprise Server and also for private repositories.

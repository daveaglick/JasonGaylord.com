Here's a punch list of what's new:

- [Variadic Tuple Types](https://jasong.us/3gghwvd)
- [Labeled Tuple Elements](https://jasong.us/2E2mPBq)
- [Class Property Inference from Constructors](https://jasong.us/3iZUavm)
- [Short-Circuiting Assignment Operators](https://jasong.us/3iZU0nK)
- [`unknown` on `catch` Clauses](https://jasong.us/3iY8KUb)
- [Custom JSX Factories](https://jasong.us/2QaBNrl)
- [Speed Improvements in `build` mode with `--noEmitOnError`](https://jasong.us/3kXimAx)
- [`--incremental` with `--noEmit`](https://jasong.us/34k5jTM)

One of the big concerns with TypeScript 4 was if there would be major breaking changes. As of now, it does not appear there will be.

To get started, install by running the following:

```shell
npm install -D typescript
```

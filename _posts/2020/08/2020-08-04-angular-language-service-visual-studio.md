If you are an Angular developer and you also use Visual Studio, you should be using the [Angular Language Service](https://jasong.us/30dRtzW) extension for Visual Studio. This extension provides rich editing and Intellisense for both inline and external templates. Last week I posted about this extension being [available for VS Code](https://jasong.us/2ZU8tLl). Previously it was unavailable for Visual Studio. By using this extension in both, you'll have a consistent experience.

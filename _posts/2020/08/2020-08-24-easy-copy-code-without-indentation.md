I often copy code in Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code where I need to hit `Shift+Tab` to remove the initial indentation for source code. I struggled to justify in my own mind that this was a solid feature request. However, Thomas Ardal has now [officially submitted](https://jasong.us/2FBFiF6).

Here's an example:

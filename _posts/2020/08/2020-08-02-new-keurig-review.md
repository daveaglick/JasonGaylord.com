After 10 years, my Keurig Elite has finally kicked the bucket. My model looked very similar to the following:

This had forced me to get a new machine. I opted to stick with the "elite" family and get the [Keurig K-Elite](https://www.amazon.com/Keurig-K-Elite-Strength-Temperature-Capability/dp/B0788F3R8X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=Keurig+elite&qid=1596140817&sr=8-2&linkCode=ll1&tag=jasongaylor01-20&linkId=3f00d98c82f7d2103b53c7719d9c996e&language=en_US) coffee maker:

For the most part, I don't notice many differences. The biggest difference is getting the Keurig to turn on in the morning and then to turn off at the end of the day. The setting for automatically turning on doesn't seem to work properly. When it does, the setting for turning off doesn't seem to work right. But, from what I see, all new models are very similar. If you're in the market for a k-cup pod machine, this is a pretty good one.

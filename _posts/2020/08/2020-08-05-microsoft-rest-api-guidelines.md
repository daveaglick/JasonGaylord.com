Microsoft has released a best practice or design principle to encourage developers to build RESTful APIs. This guide provides a good list of "SHOULDs" to ensure a consistent design of the APIs. Even better, the team is keeping their recommendations updated by using a GitHub repository. You can check out the guidelines by visiting [https://github.com/microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/vNext/Guidelines.md](https://jasong.us/33gzivg).

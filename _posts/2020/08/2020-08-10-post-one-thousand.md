It's hard to believe but when I started posting back on [April 11, 2003](https://jasong.us/first-post), I would have never expected that I'd have 1000 posts ever, let alone in less than 20 years! Over the years my posts have varied from web and application development to system administration and security. They've also included sports, business, and personal related posts. Back then I rolled my own site completely in .NET and using Microsoft SQL Server:

{% include open-thumbnail.html path="2020/08/10/original-jasongaylord-dotcom.jpg" alt="Original JasonGaylord.com landing page in 2003" %}

Which doesn't render properly now. However, a later version of that same site in 2007 renders a bit better:

{% include open-thumbnail.html path="2020/08/10/jasongaylord-2007.jpg" alt="JasonGaylord.com in 2007" %}

Then in 2011, I switched over to [Orchard, a .NET MVC CMS](https://jasong.us/2XtgQwl) that [still exists today](https://jasong.us/2XdvgQu):

{% include open-thumbnail.html path="2020/08/10/jasongaylord-2011.jpg" alt="JasonGaylord.com in 2011" %}

In late 2018, I switched over to [Cloudscribe](https://jasong.us/3ckZGFm):

{% include open-thumbnail.html path="2020/08/10/jasongaylord-2019.jpg" alt="JasonGaylord.com in 2019" %}

Earlier this year I flipped my site over to [Jekyll and GitHub Pages](https://jasong.us/3dN88ht). While I'm sure the site will change again one thing is for sure. I'm hoping to continue to post. Hopefully I can post more than 1000 times in the next 17+ years. 

Thanks for stopping by and reading!

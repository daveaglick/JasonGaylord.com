The ASP.NET team is beginning to review the backlog for items that they should include in version 6.0. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;re going to review AspNetCore&#39;s issue backlog soon for inclusion in 6.0. If there&#39;s something in there that&#39;s important to you then now&#39;s a good time to remind us why.</p>&mdash; Chris R (@Tratcher) <a href="https://twitter.com/Tratcher/status/1299305340970754050?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 28, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

With that being said, if there are items that you're looking for, ensure that you read and understand their [contributor rules](https://jasong.us/31zB6yk) and then review the issue list at [github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues](https://jasong.us/2EFACOe).

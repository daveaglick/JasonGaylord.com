Since Microsoft Edge version 83, Microsoft has included the game _Surf_ in its browser. Not long ago my connection dropped. I hadn't realized until I refreshed a browser tab in the new Microsoft Edge and found the error message _You're not connected_.

I noticed the button to play a game while I waited and found that _Surf_ would load. While the initial intention for this was an "Easter Egg", this game mimics the popular game _Ski Free_. So, of course you know you want to, go ahead and [Surf](edge://surf/)!

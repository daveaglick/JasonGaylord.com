Unfortunately, there is yet another developer and technology conference that has been cancelled as a result of COVID-19. CodeMash, which has existed since 2007, has never been cancelled [until now](https://jasong.us/3arUBf1). CodeMash 2021 would have taken place at the Kalahari Resort & Convention Center in Sandusky, Ohio January 12-15, 2021. Instead, the Kalahari conference rooms will be empty.

I've known Brian, Jason, and several others on the CodeMash team and have had much respect for their commitment to the community over the years. Knowing how committed they are to serving the technical community, this decision was not easy for them to make, but was the only decision they could make given the current events surrounding this pandemic.

Earlier this year, we announced that we had to [cancel TechBash 2020](https://jasong.us/37lAkGe) as a result of COVID-19. TechBash is a conference that is similar in nature to CodeMash.

Back on May 9th, I posted about a [limitation](https://jasong.us/3bk9UoR) with GitHub Pages. As of that time, I was unaware of an effort, [first documented on April 27th](https://jasong.us/2T46QXH), to use GitHub Actions to deploy a Jekyll site to GitHub Pages. After looking into this more, this will allow you to use Jekyll 4, some of the Jekyll 4 enhancements and even include unsupported Jekyll plugins. Be sure to check it out.

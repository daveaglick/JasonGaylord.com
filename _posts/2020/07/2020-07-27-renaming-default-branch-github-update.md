GitHub had announced back on June 11th that they were working on a way to rename the default branch structure from `master` to `main`.

Last week, GitHub had posted about the process to rename the default branch at [https://github.com/github/renaming/](https://jasong.us/2WP7NoI). In the post, they mention to wait until their tools are available. However, some are already choosing a manual migration such as the one outlined by Scott Hanselman on his blog at [https://www.hanselman.com/blog/EasilyRenameYourGitDefaultBranchFromMasterToMain.aspx](https://jasong.us/2D4cXpz).

For now, I think I'm waiting for the tools to be available. However, I may update one or two projects manually just to get a better feel for the changes.

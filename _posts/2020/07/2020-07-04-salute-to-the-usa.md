On Wednesday this week, I wrote a [short blurb about 2020](https://jasong.us/3ghednP) thus far. While we mostly cannot celebrate in the same manner that we normally would, Americans will still take today to pause and thank those that have served our country. We've made great strides as a country since 1776, and I challenge our country to make even more strides in the next 6 years when we celebrate 250 years as a nation. There are still many Americans that don't feel free or independent. We have work ahead of us and I'm certain that we'll get there. Let's not dwell on the past but change the future.

For all that have served and continue to represent our country, we salute you!

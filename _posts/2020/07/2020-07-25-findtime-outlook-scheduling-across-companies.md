A problem that many businesses have had for years is working with other organizations to find a common time to meet. Microsoft has built a tool called [FindTime](https://jasong.us/2ZU6CpS) that **requires Microsoft 365** (_formerly called Office 365_) and makes it easy to find a common time to meet. In fact, I use this outside of my day to day. My personal email account is setup on a $5/mo Microsoft 365 account. I've enabled FindTime for my account. So, if I need to find a time to meet, for example scheduling a pizza party for one of my kid's sports teams, I can simply send out a poll with a list of time slots and let the team vote. At the end of voting, if there is one clear "winning" time slot, the appointment will be auto-scheduled and the other temporary holds on your calendar will disappear. If there are multiple slots there are more options. You can even schedule a Microsoft Teams or Skype meeting this same way. 

Here is more about FindTime:

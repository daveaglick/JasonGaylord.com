We're now officially at the midpoint of 2020. I'm not sure anyone is looking back at the past 6 months thinking it has been a great 6 months. Besides a global pandemic and a fight for freedom, liberation, and justice, it's hard to believe that anything else has happened. I never thought I'd be raising children in a world that would see these events in such a short period of time. Sure, we'd read about it growing up in history class. But, being naive, never thought this would happen in 2020. I'm sure I join the rest of the world in hoping that the next 6 months are much, much better than the first six. In many cases, when an event at this magnitude hits, we look to sports or entertainment to help us temporarily forget. This time it has been different. There's no point in dwelling at the past. We are where we are. Let's push to move forward and fight for better health and equality in the next six months. We can beat 2020.

From a global perspective, check out what else has happened besides COVID-19 in 2020 by visiting [https://jasong.us/2Bs35pn](https://jasong.us/2Bs35pn).

Microsoft is hosting a half-day event today filled with topics for frontend developers. This virtual event kicks off at 11:30am EDT (8:30am PDT) today, July 29, 2020. You can add this event to your calendar and see the schedule at [https://createfrontenddevelopers.splashthat.com/](https://jasong.us/39xMKMy).

Topics that will be covered include building inclusive and accessible web applications, building static sites, serverless technologies, and more. The event wraps up with a hands-on workshop where you can use Angular, React, Svelte, or Vue to build and deploy a grocery store application and API. The workshop kicks off at 2:00pm EDT (11:00am PDT). Most of the sessions are built "lightning talk" style and are running 15 minutes in length.

**Update:** If you missed John Papa's workshop walkthrough, you can still access it by going to [aka.ms/createfrontend-swa](https://jasong.us/3hQMsDw).

The Azure App Configuration library version 1.0.1 caused client side connection issues. I shared the message in my [original post back on 6/23](https://jasong.us/3ev93nQ). On 6/29, I [posted about a temporary work around](https://jasong.us/38bjkD0) to this problem. I was notified late yesterday that version 1.1.0 of the Azure App Configuration library has been officially released. You can grab the latest version by either visiting the official [`@azure/app-configuration` NPM page](https://jasong.us/3guFbZ8) or by running `npm i @azure/app-configuration` from a command line within your project.

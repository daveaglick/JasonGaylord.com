Earlier this week, Microsoft [announced Pylance](https://jasong.us/2BYuPBI) is available in the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://jasong.us/3indlzK). Pylance offers feature-rich language support for Python inside of VS Code. It depends on the core Python extension and provides type checking, auto imports, type information and more. While Python Language Server will still exist, the long term plan is to migrate users over to Pylance. Be sure to check out Pylance and download from the marketplace.

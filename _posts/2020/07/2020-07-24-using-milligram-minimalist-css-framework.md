Every now and then a new minimalist CSS framework comes along for those looking to implement a framework for structure without carrying the weight of Bootstrap or Material. [Milligram](https://jasong.us/3fPT9oB) is one of these frameworks. At just 8.8KB for the minified style, Milligram offers a consistent look and feel for:

* Typography
* Blockquotes
* Buttons
* Lists
* Forms
* Tables
* Grids
* Code
* ... and more!

There's several utility classes that are used most frequently with other frameworks that Milligram also includes such as `.clearfix`, `.float-left`, and `.float-right`. Milligram also offers a mobile first design strategy. The default font used is [Roboto](https://jasong.us/3jxWBX3), which is available as a Google font. 

To get started with Milligram and to learn more, follow their tutorial by clicking their icon below:

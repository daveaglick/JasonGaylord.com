Back in May, I [had announced](https://jasong.us/3fBMNtn) a new Jekyll theme called [SpaacedOut](https://jasong.us/2ywUm3C). I've been making small, incremental changes on the theme since that time. This update is no different. The changes I made in this update are:

- FEATURE: Added the appropriate attributes to links for better accessibility and best practices for security. This will be reflected in a Google Lighthouse score.
- FEATURE: Updated the script that opens links in a new window to look for links that direct users to another area of a same page (`hash` link) so they don't open in a new window.

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/spaacedout.svg)](https://jasong.us/3bp45GJ)

To install this theme, you have two options:

1. [Install using the spaacedout gem](https://jasong.us/3fBMNtn#install-using-the-spaacedout-gem)
2. [Install using it as a remote theme](https://jasong.us/3fBMNtn#install-using-remote-theme)

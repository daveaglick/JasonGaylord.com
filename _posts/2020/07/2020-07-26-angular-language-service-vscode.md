If you are an Angular developer and you also use Visual Studio Code, you should be using the [Angular Language Service](https://jasong.us/2WPljsa) extension for VS Code. This extension provides rich editing and Intellisense for both inline and external templates.

**UPDATE:** You can now add the corresponding extension [in Visual Studio](https://jasong.us/2XdZpPO).

In addition, if you don't receive the Intellisense but have the plugin installed, you may have a conflict with another extension or an issue with the tsconfig.json file as [outlined on StackOverflow](https://jasong.us/3fUwebT).

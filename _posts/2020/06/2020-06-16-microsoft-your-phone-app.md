The [Microsoft _Your Phone_ app](https://jasong.us/3dbnRXi) is a great application to keep your Android phone linked with the PC. Generally speaking, it's a fairly functional app. But, there are some bugs and features I'd like to call out that I'm hoping to see fixed:

* **BUG: Phone Screen** - This does not work most of the time. When I try it on my Samsung Galaxy S10 5G Verizon Wireless device, I'll see the prompt for permission. However, after giving permission, the screen flickers briefly then the _Your Phone_ app states that I must connect to the same wireless network. But, I am on the same network.
* **FEATURE: Deleting Messages** - I can reply to individuals. I can reply to groups. I can even create a new message to one or more individuals. However, I cannot delete messages. Sometimes it's just easier using a mouse and keyboard to select multiple messages for deletion.
* **FEATURE: Detect Phone's SMS Application** - It would be nice if the app detected the default SMS application. For instance, I use Microsoft's own _SMS Organizer_. I'd like to see my messages categorized in the _Your Phone_ app.
* **FEATURE: Notification Improvements** - I can see the notifications pop up. Ideally, I'd like to click on a notification and for it to open the _Phone Screen_ feature to the appropriate app and spot. I know this feature would require a lot more work, but it would definitely be a big benefit.
* **FEATURE: Deeper Windows 10 Integration** - I wish I didn't have to launch the app. I wish the notifications would appear in the notification center like my Windows notifications do. I also wish the other features were more baked into Windows or that I'd have a subtle phone icon at the bottom next to the Windows icon.

What bugs do you experience or features would you want? I'm interested in hearing from you.

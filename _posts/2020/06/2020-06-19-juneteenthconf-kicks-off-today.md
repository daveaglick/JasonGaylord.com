The JuneteenthConf kicks off at noon today, June 19th, 2020. The event takes place June 19th-20th. The event provides a space to celebrate Black Excellence in technology and to counterbalance the biases in the technology industry. The event will kick off with an inspirational speech by Danny Thompson, a Software Engineer who worked in retail and never knew the path to a tech career was possible. There are other keynotes and sessions throughout the event. 

This event is a free virtual tech conference featuring Black people in technology. However, they welcome anyone and everyone aligned with the goal of promoting underrepresented in the tech industry to come and listen.

Visual Studio 2019 version 16.7 Preview 3 was [released on 6/23/20](https://jasong.us/2CHXgo3). Preview 3 has several new features and bugfixes including enhancements with XAML and .NET refactoring. One of the biggest areas of improvement is surrounding Git.

The Git enhancements in Visual Studio 2019 include:

* Creating new Git repositories from any folder or even a brand new folder
* Updates to the new Git Repository window
  * Viewing and managing Git branches in a tree view
  * Switching between and interacting with the history graph of each branch

From the Microsoft docs site, here is an animation showing the managing of branches and view history in a Git repository window:

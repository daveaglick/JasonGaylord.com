Over the past couple of weeks, the left-hand side of my original Surface Book started to rub on my desk. I found that a bit odd but assumed that the rubber feet may be starting to wear down. However, late last week, I noticed that the base of the machine was separating like the image below:

Assuming this is an issue with the battery, I purchased a replacement Surface Book 2 that should be arriving at some point tomorrow. In the meantime, I've temporarily rigged the top of the machine along with the Surface Dock so I can experience more 3 screens.

I'll post back once I have my new machine setup and will provide a review.

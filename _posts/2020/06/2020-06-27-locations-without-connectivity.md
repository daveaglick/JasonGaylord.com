This weekend, I took my boys on a camping trip. No, it wasn't a trip in a camper. We were roughing it in a tent which brings back the fond memories of when I was younger in the Boy Scouts. It was their first camping trip outside of the backyard. One of the things I had to get used to, which was quite refreshing, is that in 2020 there are still locations without Internet or mobile connections.

I grabbed this map from [Verizon Wireless' website](https://jasong.us/2VdxDBZ):

Trust me, I'm not complaining. We filled in the time with some good ole' fashion time disconnected. That made me curious. Do you try to be disconnected for at least a 24 hour period each year? I don't mean you still check email or social media. I mean truly disconnected?

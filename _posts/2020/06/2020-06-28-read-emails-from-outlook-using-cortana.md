Back in May, Cortana received many updates. There are still questions about the future of the personal assistant and how it works in future Microsoft products. However, there are some pretty neat features in the latest version. One of my favorites is the ability for Cortana to read emails in Outlook and to respond to emails in Outlook. You can also use Cortana to give you an update on when your next meeting is and to set reminders. For full update information, watch the video below:

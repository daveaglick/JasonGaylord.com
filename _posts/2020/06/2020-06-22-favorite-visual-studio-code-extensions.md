Ever since Visual Studio Code was released, it has quickly gained popularity. It's a lightweight code editor that is very extensible and has great performance. Because of the extensibility, you'll find developers of all flavors, not just traditional Microsoft developers, using it as their editor of choice.

Currently, I have the following plug-ins installed:

* Angular Snippets
* [Angular Language Service](https://jasong.us/2ZU8tLl)
* Azure Extensions:
  * Azure Account
  * Azure App Service
  * Azure Databases
  * Azure Event Grid
  * Azure Functions
  * Azure Logic APps
  * Azure Repos
  * Azure Resource Manager
  * Azure Static Web Apps (with Visual Studio Code Beta)
  * Azure Storage
* Beautify
* C#
* Code Spell Checker
* Docker
* Live Share
* npm
* Python
* Visual Studio IntelliCode
* Zeplin

You can find these and others on the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://jasong.us/2CqUmDX).

I'm curious to learn more about the plug-ins you use and why you use them. Please feel free to comment below.

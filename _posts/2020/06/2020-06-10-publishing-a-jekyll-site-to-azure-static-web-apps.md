Microsoft just posted a [new tutorial](https://jasong.us/2UquRss) outlining the process to publish a Jekyll site to an Azure Static Web App instance.

In the past 6 weeks, I've posted several articles related to Jekyll including [creating a Jekyll theme](https://jasong.us/35luIer), deploying your [Jekyll 4 site to GitHub Pages](https://jasong.us/2AtDz2f), and [displaying liquid templates in code blocks](https://jasong.us/36O0QIl). I've also covered a tutorial outlining the process to create an [HTML and vanilla JavaScript site using Azure Static Web Apps](https://jasong.us/2XmCKRL).

I'm interested in hearing if you are using Azure Static Web Apps and if so, what you like and dislike about them.

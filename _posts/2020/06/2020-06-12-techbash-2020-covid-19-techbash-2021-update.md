Yesterday we made [an announcement](https://jasong.us/2zofDx3) regarding TechBash 2020 on the TechBash website: 

> Over the past several months, the world has been dealing with COVID-19. Many in person events have either been cancelled or moved to a virtual format only. The organizers of TechBash has spent significant time discussing TechBash 2020. We're fortunate enough to have a venue, Kalahari Resorts, that is willing to work with us.
> 
> After much deliberation, we are cancelling our in-person TechBash 2020 conference. We would like to announce that we'll be back at the Kalahari Resorts and Convention Center in Pocono Manor, PA from October 19-22, 2021. While we are still considering our options for a virtual event in 2020, we're excited to see you all in person in 2021.
> 
> Stay tuned for more information!

While this is very disappointing, we felt this was the best option for our attendees, speakers, sponsors, and all of the families that participate and have fun at our TechBash events. We're excited that we'll be back in October 2021.

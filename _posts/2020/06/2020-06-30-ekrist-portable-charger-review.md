For a recent camping trip, I needed a new portable power bank as my others have reached their end of life. Since I needed it rather quick, I headed over to Amazon and found the [Ekrist Portable Charger Power Bank](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XQ94ZL9/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=jasongaylor01-20&linkId=3e6de785da1152ba556c6181c0df84eb&language=en_US). Wither over 2500 ratings averaging a 4.4, I felt pretty confident that this would do the trick. I have a Samsung Galaxy S10 5G from Verizon Wireless. I only used it the portable power bank once as I didn't have cell service and mostly left my device in airplane mode. I was pretty happy with it and noticed that I still had all 4 lights (above 75%) battery left after a single charge of my phone. It also happens to be smaller than my phone. Here's what it looks like:

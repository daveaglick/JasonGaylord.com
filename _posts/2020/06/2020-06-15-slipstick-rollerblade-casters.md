During the past few months working from home, my office chair mat and chair have taken a beating. Most residential setups are not meant for daily use of 8 or more hours. The latest casualty was one of the casters which had broken. We're a hockey family so it was only fitting that my wife grabbed me a set of [Slipstick Rollerblade Casters](https://www.amazon.com/Slipstick-CB690-Protecting-Rolling-Flooring/dp/B01MU7H89G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=Slipstick+rollerblade&qid=1592196414&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=jasongaylor01-20&linkId=339231e4f12ff695a02e0ad77981d17f&language=en_US).

The Samsung Galaxy S21 announcement and release are both expected in January 2021. The S21 is expected to come in 3 models: S21, S21 Plus, and the S21 Ultra. The current rumors are expecting a January 14th announcement, which would coincide with what Samsung.com sent existing customers yesterday about their virtual waiting room:

However, the phones may be announced earlier that week with CES 2021 kicking off on January 11th and wrapping up on January 14th. While Samsung is not slated for a keynote, there is a Verizon keynote on January 11th that may make mention to devices supporting the 5G network.

Last month, I posted about the Postman Galaxy conference moving to February so they could make it bigger and better than originally planned. That just happened as they've added Apple Co-founder [Steve Wozniak](https://jasong.us/3li1fby) to the list of featured speakers. In addition to Mr Wozniak, hear from the first Latina to ever go to space for NASA, [Ellen Ochoa](https://jasong.us/2TBPDEH), and several others from GitHub, Slack, Gremlin, Cisco and more at [Postman Galaxy](https://jasong.us/3jHrgjC). The event will include deep dives into Postman use cases and thought leadership in the areas of collaboration, API testing and automation, API design and architecture, developer experience, DevOps, and more! The event is free to attend and will be 100% virtual. The [main event](https://jasong.us/3ebtvuj) kicks off on Wednesday, February 3rd 2021 at 8am PST (11am EST). In addition, there are workshops on Tuesday, February 2nd. 

Are you unfamiliar with Postman? Postman is a tool used to test, construct, and validate APIs. You can download Postman for free at [postman.com](https://jasong.us/3dYwVjZ).

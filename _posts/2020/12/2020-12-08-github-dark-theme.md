Yesterday during GitHub Universe, one of the features that the GitHub team announced was a new dark theme for GitHub.com. 

In fact, there are a couple of options. The light theme is enabled by default, but there's also an option to let GitHub.com detect the theme from the system and adapt based on that. The setting can be found at [github.com/settings/appearance](https://jasong.us/3nbqbTC).

* GitHub Enterprise Server 3.0 RC1 including Actions, Packages, and CodeQL scanning
* GitHub Sponsors for Companies

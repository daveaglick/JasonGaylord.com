Amazon will still have [AWS re:Invent](https://jasong.us/36bVXJf) this year. The event will kick off on November 30th. Unlike other years, re:Invent 2020 will take place over 3 weeks and will be a free, virtual event. The event will feature new product launches, sessions, and keynote announcements. As we inch closer to the event, expect a more complete schedule of sessions to be announced. Also, there is a high likelihood that there will be new product announcements throughout the 3 week event and that they all won't be announced on Day 1.

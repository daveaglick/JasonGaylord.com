Apple has sent out invitations for [their third event](https://jasong.us/3oYYu1O) in three months. The new event titled, "One More Thing", takes place on November 10th, 2020 at 10am PST (1pm EST). This event is expected to focus on Apple's new chips, a move already announced at the WWDC back in June. Apple is also expected to focus on the Mac lineup.

Apple is hosting the event [the same day](https://jasong.us/35rYyji) that Microsoft is releasing the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. Some are wondering if this is a coincidence, an attempt at stealing some of the limelight, or if there is something else the Apple team is looking at announcing. We'll soon see.

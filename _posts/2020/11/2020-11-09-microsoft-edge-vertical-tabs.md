The Microsoft Edge dev and canary channel releases have a new feature that Google Chrome has not implemented quite yet. Edge has a toggle switch to move horizontal tabs across the top to vertical tabs down the left side of the browser. This feature is beneficial for users that have a wide screen.

I first noticed this feature in build 88, which according to the [official Microsoft release schedule](https://jasong.us/2XNw5zJ), will be released to the Beta channel during the week of December 7th and as a public release the week of January 21st, 2021.

If you are using the dev or canary release, you can change to vertical tabs by going to the menu and choosing **Settings > Appearance > and Show vertical tabs button (under Customize toolbar)**.

If you are not using one of those releases, but would like to try them out, you can [download here](https://jasong.us/32hSPu3). They can be installed side by side with another version of Edge.

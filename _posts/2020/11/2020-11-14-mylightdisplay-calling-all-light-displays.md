[We're calling all holiday light displays](https://jasong.us/38zQbDW). As many of you know, I am usually spending time this year preparing for our annual holiday light display. I am one of many that have an animated and synchronized light display. I'll be posting about changes to my display later this month. However, with the pandemic top of mind, we needed to make some changes to the content we push out on [mylightdisplay.com](https://jasong.us/38zQbDW). 

This year we want to do something different. If you are aware of a display that's worthwhile sharing with others, please send us a message with the address and if you can, a photo of the display. If you know the owner of the display, please tag them as well. We will put together a list of displays on our website. Let's share this with our friends so we can lift the spirits of all this holiday season!ðŸŽ„

Be sure to let us know by posting here, sending us a [message on Facebook](https://jasong.us/35ppHmq), or visiting our blog post at [mylightdisplay.com/blog/calling-all-holiday-light-displays](https://jasong.us/38zQbDW). Please send along the following:

* Address of the display
* Estimated hours of operation
* Brief description (i.e. What makes this display one to check ou)
* Contact information (if possible)
* Photo (if possible)

We're hoping to have our listing up by December 1st.

From our family to yours, please have a safe and healthy holiday season and be sure to follow MyLightDisplay on [Facebook](https://jasong.us/35ppHmq) and [Twitter](https://jasong.us/38BKdlT) and check out our website at [mylightdisplay.com](https://jasong.us/38zQbDW).

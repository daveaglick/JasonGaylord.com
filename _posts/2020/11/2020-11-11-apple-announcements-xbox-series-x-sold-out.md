Yesterday at the [Apple "One More Thing" event](https://jasong.us/2TWIHSX), Apple introduced the new M1 processor. The new processor will power the new MacBook Air that has a fan-less design and up to 18 hours of battery life. The new MacBook Air starts at $999.00 for a 256GB SSD model.

In addition to the new MacBook Air, a new Mac Mini, which sports the M1 processor, was announced. The 256GB model starts at $699 whereas the 512GB model starts at $899.

Last, but not least, Apple announced a refreshed MacBook Pro 13" with up to 20 hours of battery life. This device starts at $1299 for the 256GB version. If you need more storage, the 512GB model is $1499, $300 cheaper than it's Intel i5 cousin.

The Apple event seems to have overthrown any buzz surrounding the Xbox launch day. In addition to the Apple event, Microsoft seems to be struggling to fulfill pre-orders and get supply to retailers. Some who have pre-ordered from either Amazon or Best Buy received an email stating that their order has been delayed and that pre-orders should be filled by December 31st. In fact, several resellers are now trying to make a mint by selling the [Xbox Series X](https://amzn.to/36mHU3w) on Amazon as a "collectible" for $1200 or more.

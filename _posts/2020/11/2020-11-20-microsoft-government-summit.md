State and local government IT leaders and IT professionals are invited to join us for the Government Summit: Building Resilience for a Better Tomorrow on December 3, 2020, beginning at 10:00 AM PT/1:00 PM ET.

In 2020, state and local government leaders have been navigating unprecedented challenges affecting every aspect of public service delivery. Communities need to be supported, agencies need to provide employees with remote work capabilities, and residents are relying on consistent access to government services during the pandemic recovery. Efficient, cost-effective cloud services and innovation have never been more important to government agencies to address rapidly changing needs.

With the COVID-19 pandemic, the priorities to deliver new services as well as addressing budget and economic challenges have become paramount for government IT. At this virtual event, you'll learn about how other state and local government organizations are using technology to address current and future challenges, and to respond, recover, and reimagine government services.

If you're in an IT or developer role and are thinking about how to deliver services, enable remote work, and drive innovation within your government operations, while lowering cost and overhead, then this event is for you. We're looking forward to sharing more with you on December 3.

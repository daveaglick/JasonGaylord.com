This year is unlike the rest on a multitude of levels. We had intentions to have a completely different light display this year and we will. However, we won't have as large of a display as past years due to a construction project going on at our house. Our light shows will kick off on Friday, November 27th at 5pm and will take place every 30 minutes through the evening. The last show of each evening will start at 9pm. As with past years, we'll add more shows and extend the light hours around the holidays.

If you know of a light display that we should check out, [let us know](https://jasong.us/38zQbDW). We're still looking for additional light displays to share with our followers.

From our family to yours, please have a safe and healthy holiday season and be sure to follow MyLightDisplay on [Facebook](https://jasong.us/35ppHmq) and [Twitter](https://jasong.us/38BKdlT) and check out our website at [mylightdisplay.com](https://jasong.us/38zQbDW).

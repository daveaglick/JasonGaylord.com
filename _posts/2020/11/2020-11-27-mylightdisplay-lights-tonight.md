We hope you had a safe and happy Thanksgiving! I haven't been blogging as much lately as my time has been consumed with my latest light show. As [promised earlier this week](https://jasong.us/2KAkeBu), our display is set and ready to light up tonight starting at 4:30pm ET. Be sure to follow us on [Twitter](https://jasong.us/38BKdlT), [like our page on Facebook](https://jasong.us/35ppHmq), and, of course, visit our website at [mylightdisplay.com](https://jasong.us/38zQbDW) for the latest information on show times.

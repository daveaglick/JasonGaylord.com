Announced [last Thursday](https://jasong.us/2Ztbn9j), GitHub now integrates with Microsoft Teams (currently in public beta). You can install directly by [clicking here](https://jasong.us/3iqsBM6). This integration is long overdue as GitHub has had [Slack integration](https://jasong.us/2ZvzGU6) for several years. Much like the Slack integration, you can subscribe to activity using a command such as `@github subscribe [organization]/[repository]`. This will allow you to subscribe to issues, pulls, commits, and comments. You can also turn any conversation into a new issue or reopen existing issues. I'm interested in seeing what additional work they do on the integration as time passes.

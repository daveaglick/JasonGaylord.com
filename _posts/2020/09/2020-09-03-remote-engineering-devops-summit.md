As developers are continuing to work remotely, its critical that you manage your team and organization effectively and collaborate when it makes sense. Learn from members of GitHub, Microsoft, and other DevOps partners as they share how to:

* Manage remote engineering at every state of development including coding, collaborating, and shipping.
* Provide ongoing support for your developers as they adapt to remote work and new challenges.
* Adapt Microsoft remote engineering strategies at your organization.

This event will feature talks from Amanda Silver, Dana Lawson, and several others. The event will take place for North and South America next Wednesday and Thursday, September 9th-10th from 1pm-3pm EDT (10am-noon PDT).

On the heals of Microsoft's Xbox [pricing and release date announcement](https://jasong.us/35rYyji), Sony is holding a special 40-minute digital showcase for PlayStation 5 which will likely include updates from Sony game studios and third-party partners. Expect pricing and a release date from the event, which kicks off at 4pm EDT, 1pm PDT. There's been lots of discussion on social media that the PS5 will cost more than the Xbox. Hopefully we find out more details tomorrow.

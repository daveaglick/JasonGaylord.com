Did you know that you can run PHP as managed code? It's true. With the [Peachpie](https://jasong.us/351CVWO) project, a .NET Foundation sponsored project, you can do just that. Peachpie is an open-source project that allows PHP and .NET to work seamlessly as one platform. Don't believe me? Check out this video:

In fact, Microsoft had a Channel 9 feature showing Benjamin and Jakub from the Peachier project show how to run Wordpress on .NET Core.

[James Newton-King](https://jasong.us/3hXQSsm), who is most known for [Json.NET](https://jasong.us/3bnwsXi), has published [gRPC Best Practices](https://jasong.us/3i9X40R) on the Microsoft Docs site. He covers how to get the best performance possible from gRPC. Some of the topics he'll cover include:

- Reusing gRPC Channels
- Connection concurrency
- Load balancing
- Keep alive pings
- Streaming

If you're unfamiliar with gRPC, I'd suggest you start on the Docs site by visiting [Introduction to gRPC services](https://jasong.us/2QTsFYk).

<strong>Warning:</strong> <a href="https://jasong.us/2QTsFYk" title="ASP.NET Core gRPC" aria-label="ASP.NET Core gRPC">ASP.NET Core gRPC</a> is not currently supported on Azure App Service or IIS. The HTTP/2 implementation of Http.Sys does not support HTTP response trailing headers which gRPC relies on.

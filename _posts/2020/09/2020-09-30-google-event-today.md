Google is holding their new hardware launch event today at 2pm EDT. Expected to be launched at the event are a new Google Pixel, new Google smart speaker, and a new Google Chromecast. In fact, some stores are already rumored to have the new [Chromecast in stock](https://jasong.us/2EIDdal). It will be interesting to see if there will be any other new devices such as a new Google Nest thermostat or updated Google Wi-Fi system.

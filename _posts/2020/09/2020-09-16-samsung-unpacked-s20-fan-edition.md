In one week, Samsung will be unleashing their latest Samsung Galaxy, the S20 Fan Edition. This 5G phone is targeting a lower price point than previous devices. Several news outlets have reported seeing glimpses of the device appear on the Verizon Wireless website. The device is supposed to include many of the S20 specs that you're familiar with, such as the Snapdragon 865 processor, but downgrade the camera and resolution. This event also comes at a time where Apple has chosen to delay their [iPhone 12 device for a bit longer](https://jasong.us/3bUAhUi).

Beginning on [September 27, 2020](https://jasong.us/3jo3TMb), Zoom will require that all meetings have either a Passcode (password to enter a meeting) or have Waiting Room enabled for all paid accounts. Meeting passcodes were already enforced for all free accounts enabled back on [May 9th](https://jasong.us/2EGl8JQ). Meeting passcodes or Waiting Rooms will be required for Zoom Government customers beginning on October 18.

If you don't do anything to your meetings, the waiting room setting will be enabled for your meetings. It is recommended that you enable a passcode and resend your meeting requests.

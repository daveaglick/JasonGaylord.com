Did you know that you could hack GitHub and add more detail to your GitHub profile page? Well, it's not that hard especially if you already know how to use GitHub. Simply visit [github.com/new](https://jasong.us/2RSdqzH) and enter a new repository name that matches your username like so:

{% include link-thumbnail.html path="2020/09/22/github-profile-hack.jpg" alt="GitHub Profile ReadMe.md Hack" url="https://jasong.us/2RSdqzH" %}

Notice how GitHub added this little "_Easter egg_"? Of course the `README.md` file fully supports GitHub flavored Markdown. I've even tested it on my own profile and it already supports a [different default branch](https://jasong.us/2CZ12cL) not named master.

Last week at Microsoft Ignite, Paul Thurrott discovered a new feature in the latest Windows Insider build called Meet Now. Meet Now is a Skype feature. In this build, some folks are seeing Meet Now appear in their taskbar. To learn more about this, head over to his blog at [jasong.us/3kY0Rzl](https://jasong.us/3kY0Rzl).

The interesting thing here is that Microsoft is choosing to bring in this feature as opposed to tying the taskbar item to a Teams meeting and sending more folks that way. We'll see how this feature shapes out as time passes.

I've been experimenting with [Jekyll](https://jasong.us/35iEvSm) and GitHub Pages lately. Jekyll is a Ruby-based generator that uses the Liquid template langue to generate the static content. Ruby is not my most fluent language as I typically develop in C#. Did you know that there are static site generators for other languages? Jamstack has put together a website called [StaticGen](https://jasong.us/3f5KGxx) that lists the various static generators and their language. For .NET and C#, there are 7 different static generators, [DocFX](https://jasong.us/3fFHlW7) being the most popular as it's Microsoft sponsored. But, there are others. Visit their site to filter based on what languages you lean towards. I'm interested in hearing which generators you prefer and what interesting ways you are using them.

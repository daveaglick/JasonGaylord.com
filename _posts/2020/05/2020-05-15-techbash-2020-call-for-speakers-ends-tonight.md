The Call for Speakers for [TechBash 2020](http://jasong.us/tb) ends tonight. TechBash is an event geared towards web and software development, DevOps, and cloud technologies. We continue to feature speakers from a very diverse skillset and background. To submit for the event, you can visit the link over at Sessionize by visiting [https://jasong.us/tb20cfp](https://jasong.us/tb20cfp). 

[TechBash 2020](http://jasong.us/tb) is taking place from October 13-16, 2020 at the Kalahari Resort and Convention Center in Pocono Manor, Pennsylvania. This is just an hour or two drive from many major cities including New York City and Philadelphia. In addition, it's within a reasonable drive from Baltimore, Boston, Hartford, Pittsburgh, State College, Syracuse, and Washington DC. Last year we received over 550 submissions from over 200 presenters.

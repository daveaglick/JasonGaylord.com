Now that the kids are home due to COVID-19 and still doing school work, I needed to make sure everything was in order and that they all had machines to use. I booted up my old Lenovo Yoga Pro 2, which is now 5 years old, and the first issue I found was a battery that wouldn't charge. So, I had to purchase a new battery from Amazon:

and also the tools to help open up the bottom of the machine (since I could not find my old ones):

Everything went smooth for about six weeks. Then, I received a "Missing hard disk" error. Sure enough, the SSD finally failed. Luckily I had a backup and ordered a new 512 GB SSD:

All of the parts have been working great and I'd definitely recommend all of them.

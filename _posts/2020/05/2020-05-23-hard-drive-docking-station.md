One of the tasks I had while being in quarantine was to recover my aunt's hard drive. My old docking station, which was an original USB dock, would not support SATA drives. Rather, it was SCSI only. So, I headed out to Amazon to find something that would satisfy the need. I came across a USB-C and USB 3 Cable Matters SATA docking station for both 2.5 and 3.5 inch drives.

The device worked exactly as expected and I was able to perform the necessary disk checks with ease. I would highly recommend this dock if you are in the marketplace. At a price of under $25, it's hard to beat. You can get it at (Amazon)[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0099TX7O4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=jasongaylor01-20&linkId=f121e4d7576badd9e9d295d2a85c41f8&language=en_US].

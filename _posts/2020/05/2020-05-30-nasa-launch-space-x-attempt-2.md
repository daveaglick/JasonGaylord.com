At 3:22 PM EDT today, NASA will be sending their first crew on a SpaceX flight. The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will carry the two American's for the historic Demo-2 Mission. The launch will take place on Launch Pad 39-A at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The [initial attempt](https://jasong.us/2MfMhDX) was this past Wednesday, May 27th. However, that attempt was scrubbed due to weather.

Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley will become the first two astronauts to take a trip on non-government owned SpaceX. You can watch it live at [https://www.nasa.gov/](https://go.nasa.gov/2yBkYk4) or through the NASA TV YouTube channel directly below.

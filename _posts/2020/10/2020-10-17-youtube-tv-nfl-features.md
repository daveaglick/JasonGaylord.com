YouTube TV has bolstered their NFL coverage this year for customers streaming in the United States. Outside of having the NFL Channel, they also have the NFL RedZone Channel available now as an additional sports package, called _Sports Plus_ that can be added for $10.99/mo and can be removed at any time.

## Adding NFL.com Fantasy Football Alerts to YouTube TV

In addition, you may not be aware, but you can add updates for your NFL.com Fantasy Football team. To do this on your mobile device, go to **Settings** > **Sports** and choose **Connect NFL.com Fantasy Football** as shown below:

The only downside I've noticed so far with YouTube TV is that not all settings, such as this one, are available on all devices. For instance, this option is __not__ available on [Amazon Fire TV](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?k=Fire+TV&ref=nb_sb_noss_2&linkCode=ll2&tag=jasongaylor01-20&linkId=306cbb1cc84b7c4efe844af81c50cca6&language=en_US) or available through the web.

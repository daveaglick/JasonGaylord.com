In [addition to the specials I posted earlier today](https://jasong.us/3dlK6vi), more deals have been posted to the [official Prime Day 2020 page](https://www.amazon.com/primeday/ref=as_li_ss_tl?pf_rd_r=VJWZHM2452QZKG4MSPY5&pf_rd_p=0e43d06e-7b8c-4c9b-8370-10a169e25406&linkCode=ll2&tag=jasongaylor01-20&linkId=3646b0fae7ffc3faed6966a9b854c775&language=en_US). be sure to watch some "advertised" deals as they may not be as good as they sound. For instance, they are currently advertising an [Echo Show 5 with a Blink mini](https://www.amazon.com/Charcoal-Indoor-Security-Camera-Detection/dp/B086P992GD/ref=as_li_ss_tl?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&linkCode=ll1&tag=jasongaylor01-20&linkId=6fc3f606fe1c9b0b8a1d76756a75f030&language=en_US) for only $124.98. However, the [Echo Show 5](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HZLHPKP/ref=as_li_ss_tl?pf_rd_r=BNGMQPXEJQXST0D9GZWE&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_t=HighVelocityEvent&pf_rd_i=primeday_1_desktop&pf_rd_s=slot-22&pd_rd_i=B07HZLHPKP&linkCode=ll1&tag=jasongaylor01-20&linkId=cac7a1d13cdf0b008b6e2992e5e346db&language=en_US), by itself, is only $44.99. The [Blink mini indoor security camera](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X6C9RMF/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ref=pdlu_pdp_bk&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=slot-9&pf_rd_r=RJZD8BR4FPFTRTPEVWG4&pf_rd_t=0&pf_rd_p=284b0103-13bb-4ae0-bf74-f7851c086bc2&pf_rd_i=primeday&linkCode=ll1&tag=jasongaylor01-20&linkId=63115a585f5fda3a0d4bb390910a5c55&language=en_US) is also on sale for $24.99. That's a difference of $55. 

Also, Amazon has [changed their return policy](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=as_li_ss_tl?nodeId=GKM69DUUYKQWKWX7&pf_rd_r=D1QJBDS044GR93PZDQ02&pf_rd_p=32174e92-203b-4ed7-b62c-c38455cf3913&linkCode=ll2&tag=jasongaylor01-20&linkId=b48997afd9e675655eaa2569c5319823&language=en_US) and will now allow you to return most of the items shipped between October 1 and December 31 through January 31, 2021. This is great for those of you looking to scoop up a bargain during Prime Day but are looking for the piece of mind knowing it may be a holiday gift.

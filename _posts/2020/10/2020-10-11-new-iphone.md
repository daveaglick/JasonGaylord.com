Last month, [Apple announced](https://jasong.us/3bUAhUi) new hardware at an event. The event featured a new iWatch, but lacked the announcement of the next iPhone. This announcement, however, will come at an event this Tuesday, October 13th at 1pm EDT titled "Hi, Speed." During this event, expect the next iPhone will be announced to support 5G and WiFi 6. You can [watch the event on YouTube](https://jasong.us/33KFICH) or on my site here:

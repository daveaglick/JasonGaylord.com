The past couple of days, I talked about [getting started with Snowflake](https://jasong.us/31q1EkS) and also [how to query Snowflake using .NET](https://jasong.us/34c200u). In just a few more weeks, you can learn even more by attending the [Data Cloud Summit on November 17th](https://jasong.us/3dRJY76). 

During the Data Cloud Summit, you'll learn how you can easily unify, integrate, and analyze previously siloed data to enable your organization to become data driven. This is a one-day virtual event that will feature Snowflake experts and industry leaders. You'll choose one of eight tracks:

* Keynote and Headline Interviews
* Unlock the Value of the Data Cloud
* Migrating to Snowflake
* Modernize Your Data Lake and Deliver Data Engineering at Scale
* Supercharge Your Analytics and Data Science
* Build Data Apps and Data Products
* Industry Solutions Spotlight
* Mobilize Your Data with Our Data Superheroes

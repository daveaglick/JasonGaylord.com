Microsoft has announced that during .NET Conf, which will take place November 10th-12th virtually, they will launch .NET 5. The event has been virtual for the previous 9 years so no one should be surprised that this year, their 10th year, that they'd continue that trend. The event takes place over 3 days and is a free event co-organized by the .NET community and Microsoft. They've even teased a few more surprises after their big announcement on 11/10. 

Learn from some of the top speakers in the industry including Maria Nagagga, Scott Hanselman, Maddy Leger, Leslie Richardson, Carl Franklin, Kathleen Dollard, Mads Torgersen, and more! Visit [dotnetconf.net](https://jasong.us/3lTnkhb) for more details.

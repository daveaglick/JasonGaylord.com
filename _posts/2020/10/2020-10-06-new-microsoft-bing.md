In a [post yesterday](https://jasong.us/30ylBWA), Microsoft announced that Bing will now be called Microsoft Bing. While they did not announce anything new, the icon is changing to a flat green icon to a new blue icon with some depth in the icon itself. In addition, the new homepage continues to have the search bar, but also includes the ability to scroll and pull up news for your organization as well as news from around the world. If you use Office 365, I'd definitely recommend checking out the refined homepage:

{% include link-thumbnail.html path="2020/10/06/new-bing.jpg" alt="The New Bing.com" url="https://jasong.us/36FWW6l" %}

You can also search and pull up work items from Office 365:

{% include link-thumbnail.html path="2020/10/06/bing-work-search.jpg" alt="Bing Work Results" url="https://jasong.us/36N5loD" %}

Hopefully the Bing team continues to allow developers to, not only access their APIs for Bing Custom Search, but to plug into the search interface so a search in Bing would pull up results also found in internal systems.

Wally McClure, a Microsoft MVP and ASPInsider, has put together a group of posts regarding "[his life with Visual Studio 2008](http://morewally.com/cs/blogs/wallym/archive/tags/My+life+with+Visual+Studio+2008/default.aspx)." It's great that someone has time to blog about their experience with VS 2008. Seriously though, Wally does a great job explaining his experiences and working through the bugs that I have no patience to deal with.

I've been offline a lot lately preparing the arrival of our little one. Arianna Theresa was born on April 20th at 4:54pm. She was 8lbs 5oz and 21 1/2 inches long. Both mom and baby are doing just fine. I'll be offline for the remainder of the week but figured I'd post a quick picture at [http://www.jasongaylord.com/photos/Details.aspx?AlbumID=185&Page=0](http://www.jasongaylord.com/photos/Details.aspx?AlbumID=185&Page=0). Everyone wish me luck!

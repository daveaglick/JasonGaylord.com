I came across this really cool demonstration and article by Simon Pang earlier today. I asked around awhile ago for a solution where I could create a PDF on the fly using SQL Reporting Services. Cool enough, he came up with a solution. Check out his article on the Code Project at [http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/ssrs\_pdf.asp](http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/ssrs_pdf.asp).

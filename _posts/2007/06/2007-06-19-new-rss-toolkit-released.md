If you've never used the [RSS toolkit](http://www.codeplex.com/ASPNETRSSToolkit/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=3674) to generate and/or consume RSS feeds, then you're missing out. It's a very easy way to generate sound feeds and contains a `datasource` control to bind grids, etc directly to RSS. Some of the enhancements that I have made in the 1.0 version are now in 2.0. Hopefully I'll get some time later this summer to help out on the project!

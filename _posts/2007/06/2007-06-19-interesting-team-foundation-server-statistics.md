I was reading Somasegar's blog earlier trying to get caught up on what's going on out there. I came across an [interesting post from yesterday](http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2007/06/18/so-what-does-microsoft-use-for-software-development.aspx) where he talks about how Microsoft uses TFS. According to the blog, over 600 projects are currently scattered across 21 TFS server instances. In addition, over 100 million files are under source control.

One of the "constant" complaints that you hear whenever Microsoft releases a new product is around its stability. I've been impressed as of late to find out how much Microsoft actually tests their products. In fact, Microsoft is using a beta build of TFS 2008 to store and test their new Visual Studio 2008 (formerly code-named "Orcas") product. I guess that there's a really good chance that if you are experiencing frustrating issues with the products, so are they!

Thanks for the interesting post Soma!

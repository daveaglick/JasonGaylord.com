I was at the Scranton launch event yesterday. To my surprise, Mike Murphy's IT Professional talk during the morning session was "sold out" with over 600 IT pros attending. I posted some pics from the event yesterday at [http://www.jasongaylord.com/photos/Photos.aspx?AlbumID=180](http://www.jasongaylord.com/photos/Photos.aspx?AlbumID=180). I finally met Lindsay Rutter as well. Lindsay is a DE for the Mid-Atlantic region.

I've been trying to keep this blog strictly to .NET. However, this I just had to post about. If you haven't hear already (I'm assuming you have), the Northeastern part of the US was hammered with a "Valentine's Day Winter Storm." This winter has been completely mild as didn't have our first inch of snow until the latter part of January and coming into this snow storm only had a total of 7 inches. However, this storm dumped 15.5" of snow (including 2" of ice) in less than 24 hours.

I've posted some pictures from yesterday and today but by no means do these images represent what has happened over the past 48 hours.

I'll try to add more photos as I get them. One of my coworkers from the Hazleton area has taken some photos from his area. I'll post them as soon as I get them.

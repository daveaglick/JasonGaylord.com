Well, as promised, I have posted some additional photos. I haven't received any photos from others, but I pulled a few of the "better" photos off of the WNEP website as well. You can see my additional photo library at [http://www.jasongaylord.com/photos/Photos.aspx?AlbumID=178](http://www.jasongaylord.com/photos/Photos.aspx?AlbumID=178). In addition, you can visit my old posting at [http://weblogs.asp.net/jgaylord/archive/2007/02/15/snow-storm-in-northeastern-pennsylvania.aspx](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgaylord/archive/2007/02/15/snow-storm-in-northeastern-pennsylvania.aspx).  
  
At the current time Interstate 81 is closed from Wilkes-Barre to Indiantown Gap, a stretch of highway over 75 miles. Interstate 80 and Interstate 78 are still closed in spots. You can check out the latest online at [www.wnep.com](http://www.wnep.com/).

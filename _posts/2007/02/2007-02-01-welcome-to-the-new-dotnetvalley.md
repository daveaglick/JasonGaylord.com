#### [.NET Valley Releases New Website](http://dotnetvalley.com/)

The .NET Valley User Group has released a new User Group website at [http://www.dotnetvalley.com/](http://www.dotnetvalley.com/). The website places an emphasis on developers and IT professionals in Northeastern Pennsylvania. Since the group's inception in April 2003, .NET Valley has continued to grow and to support the communities of Northeastern Pennsylvania.  
  
The new website features many enhancements:  
  
- **Richer Content** - .NET Valley now provides a list of events and news as well as news from other sources such as MSDN and eWeek. By subscribing to .NET Valley's RSS feeds, you can stay up to date with the latest news and events. In addition, .NET Valley has established a better means for delivering newsletters and event notifications.    
- **Feedback** - You can now submit feedback to .NET Valley using our feedback form. You can submit any type of feedback from website suggestions, event suggestions, or potential news articles.  
- **Enhanced Searching** - Search results are provided for either the User Group site or for the World Wide Web. Use our search bar above to get the results you need.  
- **Enhanced Event Listing** - You've asked for it and we've delivered it. You can now download event notifications from the event details page for all user group events. In addition, you can access speaker biographies and session listings, download speaker presentations and/or examples after the session has been completed, and get customized directions from the event location listing provided by Microsoft's Virtual Earth.

Of course our enhancements don't stop there. You'll see lots of improvements over the next few months including job listings, member blogs, a local user group map, and more!  
  
As we mentioned earlier, your feedback is more than welcome. We're preparing to have a great year as a user group. Be sure to stop by our website today and visit the various sections.

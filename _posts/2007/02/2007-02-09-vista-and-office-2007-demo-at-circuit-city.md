Last weekend (February 3, 2007), I presented a bunch of demonstrations about Windows Vista and the Office System 2007. The turn out was fairly good. Most of the visitors had the impression that Microsoft released a very buggy operating system. I waited to post about this until today to see how the first two weeks have gone. Luckily for MS, they've been good. I grabbed a photo of my demo machine.

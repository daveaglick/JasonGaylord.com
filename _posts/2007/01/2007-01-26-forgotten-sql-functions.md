Its pretty easy to forget some of the cool SQL functions that are built into SQL server. I've been driving myself crazy adding in a custom function that would take a varchar variable and convert it to an empty string if it was null. I totally forget about the lovely IsNull function. What functions have you forgotten about before either because you haven't used it in awhile or were caught up in doing something and you couldn't remember or think clearly?

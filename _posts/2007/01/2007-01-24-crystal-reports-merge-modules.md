Wow! I've been trying to search everywhere to figure out a way to deploy Crystal Reports with VS 2005. I knew I could use Click Once to do it and I had a feeling there was a merge module somewhere. However, the Crystal module for VS 2005 is not in the default folder. Of course not. That would be... easy. Instead, I went through about 10-15 click throughs on the Business Objects website before I finally found it in the obvious location. All of the merge modules for any language and version (.NET, Java, VS 2003, VS 2005, etc) can be found at [http://support.businessobjects.com/downloads/merge\_modules.asp#07](hhttp://support.businessobjects.com/downloads/merge_modules.asp#07). The link provided herein will take you right to the VS 2005 downloads. Special thanks to [Julie Lerman](http://www.thedatafarm.com/main.aspx) for pointing out the website that led me to this.

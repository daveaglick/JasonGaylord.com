I was reading Wally's post about how [ECIS slams Microsoft over Vista](http://weblogs.asp.net/wallym/archive/2007/01/29/ecis-slams-microsoft-over-vista.aspx). I completely agree with Wally. Industry leaders seem to take an extreme amount of criticism whenever they release new items or take the "wrong" steps in getting things done. Microsoft, Walmart, GM and Ford, and even sports franchises such as the New York Yankees all experience this. I find this interesting. All of these organizations have become leaders in their industry because they have fans. Then organizations such as ECIS try to make an extra buck by attacking successful organizations. Like Wally, I don't know much about ECIS, but I find it the idea that another organization can dictate what Microsoft does a little skewed. I hate using cliches, but "can't we all just get along."

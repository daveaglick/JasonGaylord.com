It looks like Visual Studio 2008 Beta 2 is now available on the MSDN web site. According to the site, it was posted just 10 minutes ago. I've begun the download of the 3GB files and hopefully they'll be ready for install sometime tomorrow. Feel free to wait until my copy is downloaded before you begin downloading yours. :-)

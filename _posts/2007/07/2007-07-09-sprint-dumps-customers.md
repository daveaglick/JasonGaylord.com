Usually, I wouldn't post non-dev related stuff here. But, since I haven't blogged in awhile (sorry, Twitter has seemed more convenient at the moment), I figured I'd post this. Apparently, [Sprint Nextel has dumped 1000 customers](http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/announcements/sprint-dumps-needy-customers-275374.php) because they've complained too much. Great service huh?

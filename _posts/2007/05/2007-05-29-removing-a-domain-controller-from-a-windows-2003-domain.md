I needed to remove a domain controller earlier today after the hardware failed. I couldn't find an easy way to remove it from the domain. So, I contacted some friends of mine over at Synergistic Networks. They had suggested that I look at the following procedure: [http://www.petri.co.il/delete\_failed\_dcs\_from\_ad.htm](http://www.petri.co.il/delete_failed_dcs_from_ad.htm). That worked perfectly! Thanks guys!

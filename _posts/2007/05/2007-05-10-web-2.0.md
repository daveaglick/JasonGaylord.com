With Web 2.0 getting more and more publicity, you need to jump on the web 2.0 bandwagon now. AJAX and Silverlight can help you. I came across a posting on CIO.com called the Web 2.0 RapÂ (by [Phillip Gordon](http://advice.cio.com/user/phillip_gordon)):

> "Now don't you know  
> Web 2.0 is the way to go  
> You gotta go fast  
> Or you become the past  
> Whatever IT you got  
> Forget it dude, it ain't hot  
> Like Web 2.0  
> It's better than blow  
> You'll get high on Web 2.0  
> Be a media star  
> Your career will go far  
> Only do it now the gurus say  
> Gotta get it done or you're yesterday  
> Don't think about it any more  
> Cause you don't wanna be an IT bore  
> Beside they must know more than you  
> They paid so much and you're just screwed  
> So do it now, Web 2.0  
> That's it, so long, gotta go  
> I hear it call, Web 2.0."

Isn't that the truth?

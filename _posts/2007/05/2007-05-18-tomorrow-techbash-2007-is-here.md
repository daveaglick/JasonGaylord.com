Tomorrow, .NET Valley will host TECHbash 2007 at Luzerne County Community College. So far, we have over 150 registered for the event. We anticipate that by the end of the day, we'll be nearing 180. If you're anywhere near Northeastern Pennsylvania tomorrow, you'll definitely want to stop by. For the developer community, we have a SharePoint 2007 talk by Rachel Appel, a Real World AJAX and Preview to Silverlight talk by me, and a WPF deep dive talk by Ambrose Little and Ed Blankenship from Infragistics. We'll also have some great IT Pro talks including Windows Server 2008, Vista, and IP Telephony. Swag? We've got it â€” and you'll want it. The first 120 registered attendees that sign-in tomorrow will receive a free SWAGbag containing free mags from MSDN, CoDe Magazine, and ASP.NET Pro. We'll be handing out official "TECHbash 2007" t-shirts and .NET Valley pens. CACert will be on hand to provide security certificates and points towards certificates. Plus, we've got food. When was the last time you attended a conference and had Starbucks coffee? That's right, Dickson City Starbucks has donated coffee for our event.

So, be prepared to be learn technology, bring home swag, and say "I'm full!"

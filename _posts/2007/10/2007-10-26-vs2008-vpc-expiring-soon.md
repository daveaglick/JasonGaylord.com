I just read a post stating that the Visual Studio 2008 VPCs are expiring on November 1st, 2007. It is recommended that you backup any data that you don't want to lose as soon as possible. More information can be found at [http://blogs.msdn.com/jeffbe/archive/2007/10/25/vs2008-beta2-vpcs-expiring-prematurely.aspx](http://blogs.msdn.com/jeffbe/archive/2007/10/25/vs2008-beta2-vpcs-expiring-prematurely.aspx).

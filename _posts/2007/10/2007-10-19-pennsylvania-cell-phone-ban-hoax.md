I've been getting emails from numerous people about a Pennsylvania Cell Phone ban. There's been two different letters going around. One looks like a legitimate house bill and the other looks like a legislative briefing ([http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/n\_pa\_cell\_phone\_ban.htm](http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/n_pa_cell_phone_ban.htm)). If you do a quick Google or Live.com search, you'll quickly find that this is a hoax (such as [http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/bl\_pa\_cell\_phone\_ban.htm](http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/bl_pa_cell_phone_ban.htm)). In fact, there is no legislation currently in the PA State Legislation system that pertains to a cell phone ban.

I'm not impressed with the IMAP capabilities with Google Gmail. So far I've noticed that my IMAP connection has dropped numerous times. I've highlighted 60 spam messages in [Gmail]\Spam and hit delete while noticing timeouts. I've tried purging deleted items and noticed that the items delete only 5 at a time. And, I've used more than just Outlook 2007 to connect.

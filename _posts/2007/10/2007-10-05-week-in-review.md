On Wednesday, [Scott Guthrie announced](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/10/03/releasing-the-source-code-for-the-net-framework-libraries.aspx) that beginning with version 3.5 of the .NET Framework (and VS2008), the base class libraries will be browsable and can be used for debugging purposes.

On Tuesday I found out that I received the MVP award again. Congrats to all of the other new and renewed MVPs out there!

On Monday we invited a new member, David Barkol, to join the ASPInsiders. Our group is expanding and a few more developers will be added in the upcoming months.

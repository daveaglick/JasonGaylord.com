I am creating a new educational website that will allow students to sign-in and get specific information. I wanted some feedback from those of you who had used Microsoft Passport services. Is it worth setting up to support both MS Passport and custom authentication? Is it a hassle? Is it expensive monetarily? Is it expensive on your server? Let me know your opinions!

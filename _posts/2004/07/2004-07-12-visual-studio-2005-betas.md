For those of you who have not yet heard, the Visual Studio 2005 betas are available for download at http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/vs2005/get/default.aspx. All of the downloads found are Beta 1 products and do not include a go-live license. This means that they are approved for use in test environments only.

Also, visit the [ASP.NET Forums](http://www.asp.net/Forums/ShowForumGroup.aspx?tabindex=1&ForumGroupID=26) for answers, questions, and information about the betas.

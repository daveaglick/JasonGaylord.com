Have you visited your MSDN download section lately? I did the other day while looking for something and noticed that the MSDN team is giving a limited 1-year subscription to the MapPoint web service. The link for signing up can be found on the front page.

Has anyone used the MapPoint web service yet? I was wondering how user friendly it is. I've received my username and password and will be testing it after my wedding in June.

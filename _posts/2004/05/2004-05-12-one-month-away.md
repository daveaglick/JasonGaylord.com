Well, I'm now officially one month away from my wedding. It's definitely different thinking about everything that I've accomplished thus far and how much more I'll have to accomplish. The one cool thing about it all is that now I can share life experiences with my best friend. I'm usually not the type of person to become sensitive, but it is pretty neat. Well, wish me luck! (You'll know if I'm not back around by July that my *ship* must have sunk on my honeymoon ;) )

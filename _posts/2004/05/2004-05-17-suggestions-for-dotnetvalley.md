I'm looking to redesign the .NET Valley website through out the summer months. What should I consider changing, adding, or keeping on .NET Valley? If you haven't been to the website yet, please visit it at [www.dotnetvalley.com](www.dotnetvalley.com). Also, if you are in or around northeastern Pennsylvania, you can check out Phil Weber at our next meeting this Wednesday evening in LaPlume, PA at Keystone College.

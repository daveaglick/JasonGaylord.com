I wanted to share this with everyone. Our town joined a few others in a memorial effort known as a “Healing Field.” A Healing Field is a field that displays flags listing individuals who are to be remembered for 9/11. You can see Wilkes-Barre's “Healing Field” by visiting: [http://healingfield.org/staticpages/index.php/wb](http://healingfield.org/staticpages/index.php/wb)

I read an article earlier today about virus scanning for smart phones. This eWeek article can be found at [http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1737171,00.asp?kc=ewnws120804dtx1k0000599](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1737171,00.asp?kc=ewnws120804dtx1k0000599).  
  
I wonder when they'll come out with virus scanning for microwaves. ;)

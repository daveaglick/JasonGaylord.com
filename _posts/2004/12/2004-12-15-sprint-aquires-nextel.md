In a very interesting cell phone battle, Sprint announced today that it was acquiring Nextel. The $35 billion merger will make Sprint the 3rd largest cellular provider behind Verizon Wireless and Cingular Wireless. Cingular purchased AT&T Wireless last month. Who knows what's next for the wireless market. For more about the Sprint acquisition, visit http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6716519/.
 
On another note (for you race fans), I wonder if the Nascar Nextel Cup will now be called the Nascar Sprint Cup.

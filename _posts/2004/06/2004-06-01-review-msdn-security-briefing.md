Today I attended the MSDN Security Briefing in Bethlehem, PA (near Allentown). G. Andrew Duthie was the presenter. I must say, he did a fine job presenting the security topics at hand. Andrew covered some great security topics such as `DPAPI`, [`aspnet_setreg`](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;329290), Code Attacks, Environment Security, and more!!!

There is one final MSDN Security Briefing event in Bridgewater, New Jersey tomorrow. To find out more and to sign up, visit [http://msevents.microsoft.com/cui/EventDetail.aspx?culture=en-US&EventID=1032251497](http://msevents.microsoft.com/cui/EventDetail.aspx?culture=en-US&EventID=1032251497). I'd recommend going.

I've been using the GDN workspaces for awhile now. However, I've really began to notice some issues with the GDN workspaces as of late. Apparently, there are a few "rules" that need to be followed for them to work, at all. First, make sure that the 2005 .NET Framework is not installed on your PC in any shape or form. Secondly, be sure the PC is not a Windows Server 2003 box.

One of my students had showed me something interesting this past week. He used Mozilla FireFox to upload files to the Source Control. I tried it on a VS 2005 box and it worked.

After posting my frustrations on the ASPAdvice.com website, I received some interesting feedback. It appears a few others (http://www.scottonwriting.com/sowBlog/posts/2096.aspx for example) have experienced some issues with the website as well. I guess I'll just have to "suck-it-up" or move over to SourceForge. ;)

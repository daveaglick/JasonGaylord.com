When visiting the ASP.NET website, I noticed that today's featured article was about integrating PayPal into a .NET ECommerce application. I must say that the author, Rick Strahl (president of West Wind Web Connection), did a fine job explaining how to use the PayPal component. The example he has shown with the step-by-step instructions is phenomenal. Check it out at http://www.west-wind.com/presentations/PayPalIntegration/PayPalIntegration.asp.

I've been mighty quiet lately absorbing the winter atmosphere and enjoying teaching .NET at a local community college. Within the next year, there will be at least 3 more .NET classes beginning. If you are in the Eastern PA region and would like more info, give me a shout. Otherwise, I might see some of you tomorrow night at the .NET Road Show in New York City.

Last week I went to NYC to see the .NET Roadshow. Rob did an awesome job of presenting the information.  The presentation was nice to see because it covered beginner to expert level material. I know there is only one more advertised Roadshow left, but I heard a rumor that more events may be planned in the upcoming months.

I also had the chance the next night to view an MSDN event over Live Meeting. This was my 3rd Live Meeting and I will admit that the meeting quality has improved. However, there was a slight issue with the video in the beginning. Also, I don't like the fact that you need a phone to receive audio.

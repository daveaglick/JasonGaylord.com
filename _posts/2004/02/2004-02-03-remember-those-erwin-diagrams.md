I thought I'd post and ask if anyone remembers those old ERwin diagrams. These days, there are numerous tools to perform data modeling. However, 5 years ago, there were only a few. I found a CD the other day with old ERwin documents that I needed restored. With the help of Computer Associates (ca.com), I was able to open my old ERwin 2.29 files in ERwin 3.52, a special download available by contacting CA support. They have to be contacted to obtain the proper key. Then I could download the new 4.14 version and update those docs. Now I've got my docs. So, if anyone has some old docs they need converted, hopefully CA can help!

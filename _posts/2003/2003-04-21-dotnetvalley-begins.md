I have been busy lately working on starting up a .Net User Group in my area. This has held me back from posting many blogs. Hopefully I will get back into the blogging sometime in the next 2 weeks or so.

Anyway, here are a few quick updates:

- I have begun setting up my .Net User Group website ([www.dotnetvalley.com](http://www.dotnetvalley.com)).
- I have begun setting up my own site ([www.jasongaylord.com](http://www.jasongaylord.com)).
- I am slowly closing in on a date to beta my configuration editor.

If there are anymore updates, I'll add them into this posting.

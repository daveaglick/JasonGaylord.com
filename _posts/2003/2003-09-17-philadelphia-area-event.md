I just wanted to let individuals in the Philly area know of an event tonight. It's called the [Philly FUNNFest](http://philly.funn.org). The event includes many non-profit organizations in the area. At the Northeast Pennsylvania FUNNFest this year, my UG was introduced. So, there may be some good information at the event. The cost is $30 and a free Philadelphia Phillies ticket is given to each attendee. The main website for FUNN is [http://www.funn.org](http://www.funn.org). As you may already know, I do some of the web work for all the FUNN organizations.

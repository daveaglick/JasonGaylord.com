Before writing this blog, I experienced what every writer does when starting out. I had the worst case of "Gee, what can I write about?" It was horrible. So, I decided that before I begin, I might as well introduce myself.

I am a 21 year old developer from Northeastern Pennsylvania. I have been programming web sites and software for about 7 years now. Over the past 2 years, I have learned more and more about Microsoft's .Net Framework. Now, I am a top 25 poster and moderator on the prestigious ASP.Net and WindowsForms.com websites. I am also a featured columnist for ASPAlliance.com and a chosen member of ASPElite.com. In January of this year, I joined a group of individuals to form the Alliance Development Group. Together we are completing development projects and writing a book.

Besides my involvement with "nationally" known web sites, I am currently very active in my community. I am the Regional Marketing Director for F.U.N.N. (Friends United in Need Network). On April 24th, I will announce the creation of my local .Net User Group called .Net Valley. This user group will cover the Greater Wyoming Valley including Wilkes-Barre, Scranton, Hazleton, Bloomsburg, and all surrounding communities.

Hopefully my future posts will be more informative than personal. Until then, happy blogging!

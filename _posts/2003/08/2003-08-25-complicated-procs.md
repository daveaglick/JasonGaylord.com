One of my friends was recently in a job interview for a SQL Admin position. The HR representative in the interview asked him if he ever wrote complicated stored procedures. He told me this and I chuckled. What exactly dictates a complicated stored procedure? I'm interested to see what others would consider complicated, especially if you have an example. Post your “complicated procs” here.

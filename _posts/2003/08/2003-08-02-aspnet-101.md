In the Fall of this year, I will begin a part-time teaching gig at a local college called Luzerne County Community College ([www.luzerne.edu](http://www.luzerne.edu/)). In the fall, I will be teaching CIS 263, an Introduction to ASP.NET. The class will be on Monday nights from 6pm-8:55pm EST. If anyone is interested in learning more, let me know. Otherwise, I'll try to post frequent updates in the blogs regarding this.

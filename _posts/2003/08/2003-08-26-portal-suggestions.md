I recently received word from our CIO that he would like to implement an enterprise portal company wide. We currently have an in house helpdesk system that tracks technology issues and inventory. However, we are attempting to decide whether to develop in house or to choose a **canned** package. Let me know what you think. Vote here:

Choose develop internally if you'd recommend that I use DNN, IBuySpy, or SQL Digital Dashboard.

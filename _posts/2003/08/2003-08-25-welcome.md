I'm not a SQL expert by any means, but, I hope to improve my knowledge and provide valuable insight to readers. I will be posting some interesting news and facts about SQL. My information might not always be regarding SQL Server 2000 or the upcoming SQL server code-named Yukon, but it will all relate to SQL.  
  
Enjoy reading!

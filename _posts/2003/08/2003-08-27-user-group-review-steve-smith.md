Last night at our user group meeting, Steve Smith presented custom controls and caching. Though the group was the second smallest ever (very, very small), Steve did an excellent job of presenting and formulating his speeches around the members that were present. In my opinion, each individual that attended last night walked away with some additional knowledge. Our group looks foward to having Steve back in the future.
 
Also, there are a few user group updates that I have. First of all, our meetings will be switched from the last Tuesday of each month to the last Wednesday with our next meeting being on Wednesday, September 24th at 6pm. Secondly, our site has been fully switched over to our new ISP. Also, sometime in the next week or two, I am going to convert the site from the old beta version of the StarterKit to the most recent version.

Finally our [user group website](http://www.dotnetvalley.com/) is back up. You will notice that it loads much quicker now. I'll be posting some items interesting items that I find on the blogs or in the lists there as well so even if you aren't in the Northeastern Pennsylvania area, you can still get the info.

Also, on Tuesday August 26th, [.Net Valley will be hosting Steven Smith](http://www.dotnetvalley.com/Events/160.aspx) from [ASPAlliance](http://www.aspalliance.com/). Compliments of INETA, Steve will be discussing caching and creating custom server controls. Our group looks forward to having Steve speak to us.

On a final note, it appears that our membership is increasing (ever so slowly I might add) since the very first meeting. [Julie Lerman](http://weblogs.asp.net/jlerman), as our regional director, has done a superb job of helping us get this going in the right direction. I'd like to personally thank Julie for all her help to me and the rest of the group.

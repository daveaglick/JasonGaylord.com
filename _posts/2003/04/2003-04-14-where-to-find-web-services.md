One question I often get asked is "Where can I find web services?" Over the past few months, I've been searching around and have found a few good places to look:

- [XMethods.net](http://www.xmethods.net/)
- [SalCentral.com](http://www.salcentral.com/)
- [CapeClear.com](http://www.capeclear.com/)
- [Microsoft's UDDI site](http://uddi.microsoft.com/)
- [GotDotNet.com](http://www.gotdotnet.com/)

I have also gathered a list of other useful links about web services:

- [W3.org Web Services Activity](http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/)
- [WebServices.org](http://www.webservices.org/)
- [Microsoft's Web Services Development Center](http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/default.aspx)
- [Web Services Journal](http://www.sys-con.com/webservices/)
- [GotDotNet.com and ASP.net Tutorials](http://samples.gotdotnet.com/quickstart/aspplus/doc/webservicesintro.aspx)

Of course I can't list all of these sites without giving the link to my own services:

- [http://aspalliance.com/jgaylord/services/](http://aspalliance.com/jgaylord/services/)

My web services page will constantly be updated so check back for more available services in the near future!

If you find any broken links or have links that I can add to this list, feel free to send them to me.

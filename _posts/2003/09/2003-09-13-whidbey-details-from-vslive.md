I'm not sure who saw the post before, but Julie Lerman posted awhile back about a [VB.NET Whidbey Demo Video](http://www.ftponline.com/reports/vsliveny/2003/whidbey/). If you didn't know already, VSLive! in Orlando was this past week. During VSLive!, there were some hints about Whidbey. You can read about [them here](http://www.ftponline.com/reports/vsliveor/2003/dollard1/). Sounds kind of interesting.

Also, I ran into another interesting article on the FTPOnline.com website. It talks about converting Microsoft.com to a [.NET application](http://www.vslive.com/2003/ny/interview_jordan.asp).

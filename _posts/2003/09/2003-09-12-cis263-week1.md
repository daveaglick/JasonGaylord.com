Surprisingly, week 1 is already here and gone. Overall it has been a very simple week. The ClassKnowledge app is starting to take some shape and the class will be able to fully access it by this coming Monday's class. The app is similar to a Linux-based class management software called Moodle. I hope to clean it up and release beta 1 by Christmas.

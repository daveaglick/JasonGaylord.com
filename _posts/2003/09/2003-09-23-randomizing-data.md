This past week, I had an issue where I needed to randomize the data coming from SQL to use in a SqlDataReader in an ASP.NET page. I posted [an issue](http://www.asp.net/Forums/ShowPost.aspx?tabindex=1&PostID=344835)Â on the ASP.NET forums and soon received help from Scott Mitchell. He pointed out that in the stored procedure I can use the code:

```sql
Select \*  
From MyDatabase.MyTable  
Order by NewID()
```

Of course, since Scott is the .NET Data Objects King, it worked like a charm. He received that information from [http://sqlteam.com/item.asp?ItemID=8747](http://sqlteam.com/item.asp?ItemID=8747). Thanks to Scott for the help.

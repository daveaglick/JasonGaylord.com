This week I finished up my first Windows Server 2003 domain implementation. It was very interesting to see how 2003 differs from 2000. The biggest thing I noticed is security. At least on the surface, 2003 appears to be more secure. By default, everything is "turned-off" including allowing passwords that do not follow the new complexity rules. Passwords are not allowed unless they contain 1 upper-, 1 lower-, and 1 digit character as well as be 6 characters in length. Overall I thought the new security enhancements were a bit of a pain. I'm sure I'll be thanking MS later for them!

My next step now will be setting up VPN services. I'm going to attempt this one over a cable service. Wish me luck!

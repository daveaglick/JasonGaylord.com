This past week, I began finishing up a survey application. It was a request from one of the departments that needed to send out multiple surveys with multiple types of questions. Then, they needed a way to build a **dynamic query** to get the results they needed. It is a fairly cool app with 6 tables and only 5 ASP.NET pages. Not too bad. I will see if I can post the polished code in the future. It's still in beta mode.
 
One last thing: I noticed that at ASP.NET Connections in Palm Springs, Steve Smith will be speaking about caching. I think my User Group will find this interesting as he will be speaking about caching just 2 months before that conference when he visits our User Group.  :-)

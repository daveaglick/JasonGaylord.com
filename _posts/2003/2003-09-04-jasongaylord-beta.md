Today I released my personal website in beta format. After the final compilation last night, it is version 0.7.4.0. I've included my ASP.NET Blog, my SQL Junkies Blog, my ASPAlliance Articles, and my college courses. I also listed some key partner sites that have provided me with the help or information necessary for the information. Various non-profits that I participate in are also listed there as well. If you have any insight or sites that you think I should link to, let me know.

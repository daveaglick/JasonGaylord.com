In May 2020, I [had announced](https://jasong.us/3fBMNtn) a new Jekyll theme called [SpaacedOut](https://jasong.us/2ywUm3C). Since that time, I've made a couple of updates for [a 1.1.x version](https://jasong.us/3ehYK5i) and [a 1.2.x version](https://jasong.us/3bgqQyZ). Earlier this week, I added another change for a 1.3.x version. This change included:

- A separate `scripts.html` include file that is placed just above the closing `body` tag

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/spaacedout.svg)](https://jasong.us/3bp45GJ)

To install this theme, you have two options:

1. [Install using the spaacedout gem](https://jasong.us/3fBMNtn#install-using-the-spaacedout-gem)
2. [Install using it as a remote theme](https://jasong.us/3fBMNtn#install-using-remote-theme)

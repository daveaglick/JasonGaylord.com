TechBash 2022 is just 2 weeks away and we're getting super excited! We have [not one](https://jasong.us/3AdIeSI), but [two great](https://jasong.us/3ymy93f) keynotes lined up. We also have four [workshops](https://jasong.us/3fGtXBl) for attendees to choose from. Join us November 8th-11th.

### Ticket Options ###
Not sure if you can attend all four days of the event? That's ok. We have both 1-day and 3-day main conference ticket available. Tickets for all three options can be purchased on our [EventBrite page](https://jasong.us/3tFZ5to). Want to send your dev team? Reach out to TechBash to ask about discounts for groups of five or more.

### Family Day ###
Family Day returns for TechBash 2022 on November 11th. We're bringing back some of your kids' favorite activities and planning some new things too. Check out our [Family Day schedule on techbash.com](https://jasong.us/3Ty9ZMy). One of our new sponsors, Lutron, is providing some smart home gadgets for kids and parents to experiment with and learn about.

Kids are also welcome to join their parents for game night on Thursday evening, Nov 10th. Bring your favorite board, card, and dice games. We'll have some great games to choose from as well.

TechBash 2022 kicks off next Tuesday. That's right. Just one week from today! Tickets are still available for single day access as well as three day and four day conference passes. If you're looking to register for the event, visit our [EventBrite page](https://jasong.us/3tFZ5to). Would you like to send your dev team? We still can honor group discounts. Reach out to groups (at) techbash.com for more details.

Below you'll find all you need to know for TechBash 2022.

## Conference Sessions and Schedule ##

**Pre-Conference Workshops**
There are four different pre-conference workshop tracks to choose from. You can find out more by [clicking here](https://jasong.us/3fGtXBl).

**Keynotes**
This year, we have two great keynote presentations. On Wednesday, former detective Crux Conception will be presenting an interesting topic called [Is there #Stress in the world of #Tech?](https://jasong.us/3ymy93f). On Thursday, Amazon's Jeff Blankenburg will present [The Future of People](https://jasong.us/3AdIeSI).

**Main Conference Sessions and Schedule**
This year we have more [sessions](https://jasong.us/tbsessions) than our previous events. These talks will take place Wednesday through Friday next week. If you can't make the full conference but want to see which single day you'd like to come, I highly recommend checking out the [conference schedule](https://jasong.us/tbschedule).

**Family Activities**
Like previous years, family members are encouraged to begin joining TechBash on Thursday night for Family Game Night. On Friday, we have a full state of activities from using smart devices from Lutron to self defense activities. You can see the full slate of activities by [clicking here](https://jasong.us/3Ty9ZMy).

## Staying at the Kalahari ##
While our deepest discounts expired, we can still receive 10% off by [booking online here](https://jasong.us/3ztM5tM). You'll want to stay on the property as we'll have activities into the late evening hours on both Wednesday and Thursday evenings.

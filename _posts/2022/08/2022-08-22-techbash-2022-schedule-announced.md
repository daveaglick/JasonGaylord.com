The TechBash 2022 schedule has been announced and is posted at [techbash.com/schedule](https://jasong.us/tbschedule). While there still may be some changes to the schedule, this will provide some insight into which talks will be when during the event. 

I'm happy to announce that you have until the end of this month to use discount code **SUMMER50** to save $50 off your individual ticket purchase. This applies to new purchased tickets only and does not stack with any other discounts such as group rates. We currently have 3-day main conference tickets available as well as the 4-day pass which includes a pre-conference session. Tickets for both the 3-day and 4-day conference passes can be purchased on our [EventBrite page](https://jasong.us/3tFZ5to). If you are interested in group rates, please reach out by sending an email to groups @ techbash.com. 

In addition, there are still discounted rooms available at the Kalahari, but this rate will only be around until early October or until the rooms are completely sold out. To book a room, follow the process outlined in our [Stay and Play section](https://jasong.us/hotelreg) of the website.

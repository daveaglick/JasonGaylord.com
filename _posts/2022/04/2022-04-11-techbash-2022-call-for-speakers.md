After back to back years of being cancelled, TechBash 2022 will be taking place in person on November 8-11, 2022. Even more, you have between now and this Wednesday, April 13th to submit a proposal for a standard session or workshop for the event. 

Submit your proposed session or workshop at the [Sessionize CFP page here](https://jasong.us/36hydqw).

TechBash 2022 will take place at the Kalahari Resort and Convention Center in the Pocono region in Pennsylvania November 8-11. We'll kick off the week with an optional day of workshops on Tuesday, November 8th followed by three full days of sessions. There will be additional details forthcoming about our keynote presenter(s). For complete details about our CFP, read the TechBash [post on the TechBash website](https://jasong.us/36fcJe0). We hope that the world continues making progress in the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and that we can finally be back with our friends and colleagues this year at the Kalahari.

Stay posted for more information.

As we continue to inch closer to TechBash 2022, I wanted to take a moment to let you know that discount rooms are available for the event at the Kalahari Resort and Convention Center in Pocono Manor. For more details, visit [techbash.com/#HotelRegistration](https://jasong.us/hotelreg). Our room rates are secured until Friday, October 7th, but I would not wait as our room block has sold out in previous years. 

The resort has 977 rooms and suites for you to choose from. Room rates start at just $169 per night for a Double Queen Sofa room (formerly known as a Desert room) for Monday through Thursday. On Friday night, the rate is just $189. 

Water park wristbands are included, but must be requested upon check-in, for up to 4 individuals per room. Additional wristbands can be purchased for an additional fee. Also included in the price is complimentary wireless internet services in guest rooms and meeting space, self-parking, and access to the fitness center. There are multiple restaurants and other activities on site. In addition, we were able to get the resort fee waived for our event giving you the best price possible.

To reserve your room, you can do so online or by calling the toll free number available on the TechBash website. Visit [techbash.com/#HotelRegistration](https://jasong.us/hotelreg) for more information.

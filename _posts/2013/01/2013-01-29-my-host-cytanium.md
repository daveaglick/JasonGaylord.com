So I'm asked quite often who I use for hosting. There was a time when I hosted my own stuff and co-owned a small, regional hosting firm. In fact, at one point, I think we had nearly 50 business customers. However, time has passed and the hosting space became way too competitive for us. We didn't have a multi-location infrastructure and the most complex load-balancing method we used was DNS load balancing. Even though we started to back off from business hosting, I still hosted my own site. That is, until one of my good friends, [Brad Kingsley](http://jasong.us/VTyRMz), had approached me about testing out a new service they were going to be providing.

If you don't know Brad, he is the founder and CEO of [Orcsweb](http://jasong.us/VTyUb8). Even though companies such as Rackspace or GoDaddy are more recognizable, Orcsweb has still found a way to succeed and host some really popular websites and web applications.

[Cytanium](http://jasong.us/VTAc5X) is a service that Brad's team had developed a few years ago. It is a Windows shared hosting service that offers reliable Windows hosting at a reasonable price. In fact, you can get Windows hosting for as cheap as $2.50 per month! You can also get VPS hosting through them. I'd definitely recommend checking them out.

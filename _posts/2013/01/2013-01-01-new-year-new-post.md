So, it's been just over a month since my last post. But, I haven't been too quiet. In fact, I was hard at work customizing and updating one of my other websites, [MyLightDisplay.com](http://MyLightDisplay.com). Each year the holidays tend to consume any time I'd typically have to post or work on projects. This year, I have had two different projects that has had 90% of my focus and the other 10% went into our Christmas light display and [MyLightDisplay.com](http://MyLightDisplay.com). However, 2013 will be a bit different. I'll be blogging more and will be in the community even more than I have been. I've got a couple of things I'll be talking about shortly so stay tuned. In the meantime, thanks as always for stopping by and Happy New Year!

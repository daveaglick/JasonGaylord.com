So today is the big day where my wife is being induced with our fourth child. Given the past, today's experience should last between 6-10 hours. Knowing I'll be hearing monitors in the background, I figured I should do some work. Since I haven't spent the time to complete an app for Windows Phone yet I figured I would challenge myself. I'll be live blogging this experience today and am up against mother nature. My goal is to see what comes first: my new baby boy or my new Windows Phone app. Wish me luck (on both fronts)!

7am: It's beginning â€“ I have an idea on paper. Notice the attention to detail.

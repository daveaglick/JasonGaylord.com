I've kept track of tweets. I've kept track of the user group anniversary date. I've kept track of my marriage anniversary date. But, for some reason I forgot about when I started blogging. That was, until one of my good friends, G. Andrew Duthie, [blogged about forgetting about his blogging anniversary as well](http://jasong.us/1c7KjiS).

Like Andrew, [my first blog](http://jasong.us/1c7LnTU) was also up on the [](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgaylord)[ASP.net blog site](http://jasong.us/1c7LNK1). Over the years I have compiled 570 posts on that site (interesting coincidence since our area code is 570) before switching to my personal site. I've posted (technology only) a total of 632 times over a 10 year span. I kept several different blogs in several different locations. I've since consolidated everything into one location.

Before I end this post, let's reminisce:

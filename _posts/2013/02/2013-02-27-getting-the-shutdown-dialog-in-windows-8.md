One of the tasks that seem awkward in Windows 8 is the shutdown and restart process. One of my co-workers, Mark Beleski, had discovered a nice keyboard shortcut today. It's nothing new, but something that I rarely used.

```
Alt + F4

If you're in an application, this usually closes out of the app (in desktop or the start menu modes). However, if Windows Explorer has focus (such as clicking on the task bar), you can press this key combination to get the shutdown dialog box:

I figured you may ask. Since my last post, I have been working hard to prepare and organize Northeastern PA's only true technology conference, [TECHbash 2012](http://techbash.com/). The event was great! Everything was a huge success and the attendees seem to be pumped up for TECHbash 2013. Although we're still 11 months away from our next event, we are already planning for the next one. If you think you may be interested in speaking, sponsoring, or volunteering, please let me know. We'll have our first meeting regarding the event in August to begin carving out the details.

Thanks to all that made this year's event a success!

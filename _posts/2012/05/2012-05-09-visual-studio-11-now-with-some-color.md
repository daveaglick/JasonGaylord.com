The Visual Studio is constantly reviewing items that have been posted to their [User Voice site](http://jasong.us/ydi2ri). One of the items that I've been asking for, [installation customization in Visual Studio](http://jasong.us/zYucyv), has been voted up to number 4 on the list. Keep the votes coming.

Another item that I have voted for is [adding color back to Visual Studio](http://jasong.us/JwYL1r). Yesterday morning, the Visual Studio team [announced](http://jasong.us/JwZi3z) that changes have been made and will be reflected in the Visual Studio Release Candidate. While I still feel there can be more work on the UI, I think it is heading back in the right direction. I get the consistent look that the teams are going for across products and Microsoft is betting heavily in the metro-style.

Some of the items that have been changed include changes to the icons, adding in more color to icons and menu items, and creating a lighter background.

Here's a quick before and after shot borrowed from their post:

Here's what it looks like based on the state of your development process:

Hopefully we'll continue to see more improvement before the RC.

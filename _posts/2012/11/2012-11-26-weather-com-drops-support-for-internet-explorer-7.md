Earlier this evening, I visited [weather.com](http://weather.com/) to find the following:

I'm quite surprised that IE7 is being dropped especially on such a popular website. However, I commend them on moving forward. IE7 is now over 6 years old and [estimates are that less than 3%](http://jasong.us/UoS09H) of users are still using IE7. That's less than Internet Explorer 8, Internet Explorer 9, Chrome 22, Firefox 15, Firefox 16, and even Internet Explorer 6 â€“ [which is slowly dying off, but not fast enough](http://jasong.us/UoS0GG).

As a reminder, if you're using Windows 7, you can download [Internet Explorer 10 Release Preview here](http://jasong.us/UoSD2S).

Do I really need to say anymore? NEPA BlogCon will be one of the best conferences in Northeastern Pennsylvania. This is coming from the guy that assists in organizing TECHbash and NEPA GiveCamp. My talk will be about starting blogging and using a CMS to it's fullest abilities. We'll check out WordPress, Blogger, and Orchard CMS. I'll show how to customize and extend each.

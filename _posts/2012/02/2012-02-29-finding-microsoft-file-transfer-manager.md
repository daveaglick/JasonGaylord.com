Earlier today, Microsoft released Windows 8 Beta. Of course, when I was downloading it, I had to leave and head to another building. So, I paused my download in the Microsoft File Transfer Manager. However, I couldn't find it easily again. I finally found a blog post saying it was called TransferMgr.exe. I searched my machine and found it at "C:\Windows\Downloaded Program Files\TransferMgr.exe". Be sure to look for it there first in the event of needing it.

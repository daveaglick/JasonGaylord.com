The ASP.NET MVC 4 Beta and Web API Beta have just been released. You can visit the [asp.net](http://www.asp.net/mvc/mvc4), [msdn.microsoft.com](http://msdn.microsoft.com/), or [Microsoft Download Center](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=28942) to download the latest bits.

ASP.NET MVC 4 includes many new features including, but not limited to:

-   New project templates such as the mobile project template.
-   Support for Mobile apps
-   Support for Recipes (similar to, but not quite, like recipes in the Orchard CMS)
-   Support for Async methods (think new async features)

The Web API allows API's to be built using WCF and REST.

Be sure to check out both. I'll be posting more on it later on.

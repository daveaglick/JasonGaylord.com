Earlier today Microsoft released Visual Studio 11 Beta as a general release. One of the first things you may notice is that the installation customization of VS11 Beta has been removed. If you are installing VS11 on Windows 8 Beta, you're looking at consuming around 20GB of disk.

So Microsoft already released the beta so their mind is made up, right?

Not exactly. The team is constantly looking at feedback on the [http://visualstudio.uservoice.com](http://jasong.us/ydi2ri) website. One of the items that I've submitted is to bring back the customization. You can use up to three (3) of your User Voice votes for Visual Studio by voting for this item below:

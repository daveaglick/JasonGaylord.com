After much anticipation, Windows 8 is now available to MSDN and TechNet subscribers. There are two versions to download. One version is Windows 8 which has Windows 8 Pro capabilities (with the appropriate key). The other is Windows 8 Enterprise which requires a KMS or adding the key using a script ([](http://jasongaylord.com/blog/windows-8-enterprise-activation)[as blogged about here](http://jasong.us/TFupiV)).

Non-subscribers of MSDN and TechNet can download a 90 day trial for free by visiting [http://jasong.us/N4fJoR](http://jasong.us/N4fJoR). However, if you install this trial version, you cannot upgrade to the full version when it is released for general availability on October 26th. Instead, users will be required to copy their files to an external drive or network as a backup.

In addition to the new Windows 8 releases, [Visual Studio 2012 was also released](http://jasong.us/TFw0Fs).

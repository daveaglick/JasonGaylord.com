I just watched a piece about [HurricaneTrack.com](https://jasong.us/3fDq9AP). The owner, [Mark Sudduth](https://jasong.us/2WnVZtz), lives in the Southeast North Carolina area which is the area that Hurricane Florence, currently a Category 4, is targeting. Mark has devices that he'll be placing throughout the region to safely show video, wind speeds, pressure and more without the need of others being in harms way. Unfortunately his app is only available for the iPhone but if you have an iPhone, I'd highly recommend checking his app out. If you don't have an iPhone, he'll be helping the Weather Channel deliver some of their video.

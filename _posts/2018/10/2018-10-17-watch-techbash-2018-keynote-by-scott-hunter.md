If you haven't had an opportunity yet, I recommend watching the TechBash 2018 keynote by Scott Hunter. Scott detailed the journey of the .NET framework including it's past, present, and future states. The video can be watched on the TechBash YouTube Channel. As the TechBash Foundation will be launching additional videos over the next several weeks, [I highly recommend subscribing to the channel to keep posted on what's coming next](https://jasong.us/tbyt).

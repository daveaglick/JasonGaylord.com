I’ve just launched my new JasonGaylord.com website a few hours ago. My new website is using [CloudScribe](https://jasong.us/3bogZVs), a .NET Core Content Management System. If you’re unfamiliar with CloudScribe, it’s an open source project that’s championed by [Joe Audette](https://jasong.us/2WLOonB). Please let me know what you think of the new structure as I’ll be continuing development and will hopefully begin adding more relevant content on the website again.

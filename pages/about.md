#### Quick Bio
Jason is the AVP of Application Development and Infrastructure for [biBERK.com](https://jasong.us/biberk), a Berkshire Hathaway Insurance Company.

In addition to his daily duties, Jason, is a founding board member of the [TechBash Foundation](https://jasong.us/tbfoundation), organizer of [TechBash](https://jasong.us/tb), [ASPInsider](https://jasong.us/3csnPdY), and a [former Microsoft MVP](https://jasong.us/msftmvp). He creates web applications and has even authored a book. He resides in Northeastern Pennsylvania with his family.

#### Technical Background
It all started back in 1995. My uncle gave me my first Windows computer -- a Compaq Presario 33MHz machine. I didn't have a math coprocessor chip and lacked a turbo button. But, it did the trick. It allowed me to get started writing Quick Basic and Pascal applications. Here's a snippet of an application I wrote back then for the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta Georgia:

```vb
CLS
SCREEN 1, 0
CIRCLE (105, 50), 20, 1
CIRCLE (150, 50), 20, 1
CIRCLE (195, 50), 20, 1
CIRCLE (127.5, 72.5), 20, 1
CIRCLE (172.5, 72.5), 20, 1
1 CLS : COLOR 7, 0
PRINT "MAIN MENU:": PRINT
PRINT "(0) END"
PRINT "(1) VIEW DATA"
PRINT "(2) PLAY GAME"
PRINT "(3) SEE CREDITS"
PRINT
INPUT "WHAT IS YOUR CHOICE"; C
IF C = 0 THEN CLS : END
IF C = 1 THEN GOSUB 100
IF C = 2 THEN GOSUB 200
IF C = 3 THEN GOSUB 300
CLS : GOTO 1

Fast forward to fall of 1999. I was a student at Penn State Wilkes-Barre studying in a new major called Information Sciences and Technology ([IST](https://jasong.us/3cyZhjq)). The IST program required me to pick a focus. Since I already had an interest in programming, I did take the Software and Web Development path. I was quickly introduced to Microsoft Visual InterDev and Microsoft Active Server Pages, also known as Classic ASP.

Right before my 3rd semester, a friend of the family had introduced my to a local accounting firm then called Parente Randolph. I started with Parente in September of 2000. When working for Parente, I built many applications including a helpdesk system for our department. It was a Classic ASP application that stored data in Microsoft SQL 2000. In 2001, I started investigating this new technology that I found online called ASP.NET. At the time, I knew that there was a new language called C#, but I focused on Visual Basic.NET. I spent quite a bit of time learning about ASP.NET writing small applications and responding on the [ASP.NET forums](https://forums.asp.net/). I quickly rose to be a Top 25 poster on the forums and was invited to Building 20.

Around that same time, I joined a new Microsoft sponsored program called the [ASPInsiders](https://jasong.us/3csnPdY). Being an ASPInsider allowed me to learn more about .NET and to test many of the features before the general public. Having this access was a two way street -- I would provide feedback to Microsoft about the features and in turn they'd provide me with early access.

On April 11, 2003, I authored my very first blog post. I've ported it from my old .Text Weblog on ASP.NET over to here. [Read it now](https://jasong.us/first-post). I know. Not that inspiring. Ten days later on April 21, I [announced](https://jasong.us/2AtKiJD) that I was starting a local user group called .NET Valley. While .NET Valley no longer exists, it was one of the only technology user groups in Northeastern Pennsylvania.

From there, I started writing articles for an online technical source called ASPAlliance.

Before I left Parente in September 2003, I was notified that I would be a [Microsoft MVP](https://jasong.us/msftmvp). In September, I started working for United One Resources, a company that offers title insurance, credit reports, and courthouse record searches for customers. The primary application I was to maintain was a VB6 application. Still stuck in a VB world, I started to expand out further into the world of C# writing articles and applications. I also expanded into other areas of technology by helping to maintain our network and servers.

In November 2013, I made the choice to leave for Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance. I've been with Berkshire Hathaway ever since and now lead the technology team for [biBERK.com](https://jasong.us/biberk), a direct market commercial insurance company.
